I HAVE NO IDEA
I AM REALLY ANNOYED
NO WAY
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
WE NEVER PLAY BOARD GAMES
PUZZLES ALWAYS TAKE TOO LONG
I'VE BOUGHT SOME REALLY CHEAP TICKETS
HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR JACKET
SHE'S PRINTED HER BOARDING PASS
HAS HE LOST HIS PASSPORT
SALLY AND DAVE HAVE PACKED ALREADY
THEY'VE WORKED REALLY HARD
HERE'S MY TICKET AND PASSPORT
MY FLIGHT HAS BEEN DELAYED
I HAVE ONE BAG TO CHECK AND ONE TO CARRY ON
I'VE ALWAYS HAD MY BAGS WITH ME
I'D LIKE AN AISLE SEAT
MY FLIGHT DEPARTS FROM GATE C TWO
I HAD TO CHANGE PLANES IN BAHRAIN
AT CUSTOMS THEY LOOKED THROUGH MY LUGGAGE
THEY CHECKED MY VISA WHEN I WENT THROUGH IMMIGRATION
I'M JET LAGGED AND I NEED SLEEP
BACK HOME IT'S ABOUT TWO A M
I THINK HE'S FEELING SOME CULTURE SHOCK
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE BLUE LAGOON
NO I HAVEN'T
I'VE ALREADY SEEN NIAGARA FALLS
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN VICTORIA FALLS YET
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO CANADA
I'M PLANNING AN AMAZING TRIP
IT'S DOWN TO TWO OPTIONS
I'M PLANNING TO GO TO KENYA OR ANTARCTICA
MY PLAN IS TO SEE LIONS OR PENGUINS
I WAS VISITING HER BROTHER
HE WAS SWIMMING IN THE POOL
WE WERE PAINTING PICTURES
WERE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME
WAS HE GOING TO SCHOOL
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
WORKING WITH MOM WAS A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
HEATHER GOT AN UNEXPECTED PROMOTION AT WORK
I'M LUCKY THAT I MET CASEY
FORTUNATELY JEAN FOUND HER WALLET
SURPRISINGLY HE DIDN'T GET THE JOB
AFTER OUR ROAD TRIP I FELT FANTASTIC
I WAS REALLY UPSET WHEN I GOT FIRED
I FORGOT THE DATE AND FELT GUILTY FOR THREE DAYS
DID HE SEEM CALM AFTER GOING TO THE SPA
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENED
EVERYONE SEEMED SO EMBARRASSED
WHILE IT WAS RAINING HE TOOK A NAP
THE PHONE RANG WHILE I WAS TAKING A SHOWER
SHE WAS WATCHING TV WHILE HE WAS STUDYING
I DIDN'T SEE THE SIGN WHILE I WAS DRIVING
JOE WAS THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTER IN THE FILM
THAT FILM HAS SOME OF THE BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS EVER
EMMA' HAS SOME OF THE BEST COSTUMES OF ALL TIME
THIS MOVIE HAD ONE OF THE WORST PLOTS EVER
MARILYN MONROE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS OF ALL TIME
LOVE STORY' HAS ONE OF THE WORST SOUNDTRACKS EVER
SHE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DIRECTORS OF ALL TIME
WHO STARS IN THE MOVIE
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS MOVIES EVER
WHY IS IT YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME
DOES IT HAVE A GOOD SOUNDTRACK
WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END
LET'S WATCH IT TOGETHER
WHICH MOVIE DO YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT ABOUT THIS TOM HANKS MOVIE
WHAT'S IT CALLED
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT
IS IT IN COLOR
DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE GOOD
THE POPCORN'S ALREADY MADE
THERE ARE TOO MANY PLASTIC SANDALS
SHE WEARS TOO MUCH MAKEUP
I HAVE ENOUGH SHOES
HE HAS TOO MANY HATS
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
SHOPPING TAKES TOO MUCH TIME
I DON'T WEAR REAL FUR ONLY FAKE
SHE PREFERS CLASSIC TO TRENDY STYLES
DO YOU PREFER LOOSE OR TIGHT JEANS
OUR OFFICE CLOTHING IS FORMAL BUT FRIDAYS ARE CASUAL
IS THIS IN STYLE OR OUT OF STYLE RIGHT NOW
THOSE JEANS ARE WAY TOO TRENDY
HE DOESN'T KEEP UP WITH FASHION TRENDS
I THINK FASHION'S ALL ABOUT SELF EXPRESSION
SHE PREFERS CASUAL CLOTHING
I'LL TRY ON THAT SHIRT WITH THESE PANTS
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR CLOTHES
THIS STYLE IS REALLY HOT RIGHT NOW
SHE'S MY FAVORITE DESIGNER
I LOVE THE DESIGN OF THIS SUIT
THIS IS MY FAVORITE BRAND OF JEANS
YOU DON'T THINK I LOOK TOO FAT
YOUR OUTFIT MAKES YOU LOOK THIN
HOW DO YOU LIKE MY HAT
IT LOOKS GREAT ON YOU
IT LOOKS AMAZING ON YOU
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH PETER CASS

HOW IS THE CHICKEN
THE CHICKEN IS HORRIBLE
I DON'T LIKE CARROTS
I WANT AN APPLE
I WANT SOME WATER
DO YOU WANT SOME RICE
AN APPLE IS A FRUIT
CHEESE IS A DAIRY PRODUCT
CHICKEN AND BEEF ARE MEATS
RICE AND NOODLES ARE GRAINS
CARROTS AND POTATOES ARE VEGETABLES

WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK
YES A GLASS OF WATER PLEASE
ANYTHING ELSE
NO THANKS
YES I'D LIKE A ROAST BEEF SANDWICH
EXECUTIVES EXPECT TO DEAL WITH CHALLENGES
I WASN'T AWARE OF THE MERGER UNTIL YESTERDAY
HOW MANY ITEMS ARE THERE ON THE AGENDA
DID THE CEO RESIGN OR WAS HE FIRED
THE CFO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NUMBERS BEING ACCURATE
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
IF I COULD HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE
OK EVERYONE LET'S GET STARTED
DOES EVERYONE HAVE AN AGENDA
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING I KNOW THAT YOU'RE BUSY
THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S MEETING IS A COMPANY UPDATE
THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS AN UPDATE FROM THE CFO
OK EVERYONE COULD I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
DOES EVERYONE HAVE A COPY OF THE AGENDA
THE PURPOSE OF OUR MEETING IS TO DISCUSS SALARIES
THE PRIMARY PROBLEM IS OUR COMPETITIVENESS
FOR INSTANCE WE'RE LOSING SALES IN ASIA
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE FACE
HOW COULD WE TAKE THE IDEA ONE STEP FURTHER
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU PROPOSE AS A SOLUTION
THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE OFF TO A GOOD START
DO TEAM BUILDING EXERCISES IMPROVE MORALE
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU A BIGGER BUDGET FOR THAT PROJECT
EVERY EMPLOYEE IS EVALUATED BY A MANAGER
I AGREE WITH YOU
I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA
WE'RE DEFINITELY ON THE SAME PAGE
I'M NOT WITH YOU ON THAT
I'M SORRY BUT I DISAGREE
I THINK THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA
HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO INCREASE THE BUDGET
I DIDN'T THINK WE'D HAVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS
TEAM MEMBERS WHO MISS DEADLINES SHOULD BE PUNISHED
HANG ON A MINUTE I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH YOU
I PROPOSE THAT EXCELLENT EMPLOYEES GET REWARDED
ONE WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS TO CHANGE THE SEATING
SHE COMPLETED ALL OF HER TASKS SMOOTHLY
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A COORDINATION PLAN
THIS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PARIS AND LONDON IS TOUGH
WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE WHILE YOU'RE AWAY
THE MEETING WILL INVOLVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE
THE SOONER WE CAN CONCLUDE THE DEAL THE BETTER
I'VE INFORMED THE BOARD ABOUT THE MERGER RUMORS
UNLESS ANYONE HAS ANYTHING ELSE I THINK WE'RE DONE
THAT'S ABOUT IT LET'S WRAP THINGS UP
I THINK WE'RE READY TO TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS
AS A NEXT STEP I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH A COMPANY REPORT
NOTHING WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE LEAVES THIS ROOM
EVERYTHING WE'VE DISCUSSED IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING
I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBTS OR REGRETS ABOUT MY DECISION
HE TURNED DOWN THE JOB OF CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO INTEGRATE THE TWO COMPANIES
SHE WAS REPLACED BECAUSE HER DEPARTMENT WAS A MESS
HE'S DECIDED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO REPLACE THE COO
THE BOARD HAS DECIDED TO HIRE HIM FINALLY
I NEED HELP WITH A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION
I THINK THE DECISION WAS A SMART MOVE
I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT THE DECISION
I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE MOVE ON YOUR PART
MOM HOLDS ONTO SOME TRADITIONAL VALUES
THE LITTLE THINGS ARE NICE
LILY THINKS OF HERSELF AS A FEMINIST
TIMES HAVE CHANGED IT'S SO COMPLICATED
LIAM WANTS A WOMAN WHO CATERS TO HIS EVERY NEED
ARE YOU SAYING THAT MEN AREN'T SOCIAL ENOUGH
YES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE ENGINEERS
NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING AT ALL
WHAT FUN
WHAT A SHAME
HOW THOUGHTFUL
HOW IRRESPONSIBLE
HOW BORING
WHY DO MEN AND WOMEN BOTHER DATING
SHOULDN'T WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
ISN'T IT TIME FOR US TO ACCEPT GENDER DIFFERENCES
WHO CREATED SUCH RIGID ROLES
SHE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE STRAPPED FOR CASH
HE'S ABSOLUTELY LOADED HE HAS TONS OF CASH
THE BIGGEST PART OF MY MONTHLY EXPENSES IS MY RENT
WITH NO SOURCE OF INCOME SHE'S BUILT UP A LOT OF DEBT
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CASH BUT WE'RE GETTING BY
MY BEST FRIEND IS COMPLETELY BROKE RIGHT NOW
HOW ARE YOU WITH MONEY
HOW ARE THEY DOING FINANCIALLY
SHE HAS NO CLUE WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING HER FINANCES
IT'S ANY WONDER THEY'RE NOT LIVING OUT ON THE STREET
WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE FINANCIALLY
SHE'S SMART WITH MONEY
I HAVE TO ASK MY LANDLORD FOR AN EXTENSION ON MY RENT
IT'S HARD TO FEEL INDEPENDENT WHEN YOU OWE MONEY
I CAN'T LEND YOU MONEY BECAUSE I'M BROKE
I'M PAYING BACK THE LOAN WITH SOME OF MY SAVINGS
I'M SORRY TO ASK BUT CAN I BORROW SOME MONEY
ARE YOU KIDDING ME MAN IT'S JUST A TINY LITTLE LOAN
THAT IS THE WORST THING I'VE EVER HEARD
THESE LOAN PAYMENTS ARE KILLING ME
I ASKED TO BORROW SOME MONEY AND HE FREAKED OUT
HE WAS SO NICE AT THE BANK HE SAID NO IMMEDIATELY
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE TONS AND TONS OF MONEY
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET A BANK LOAN
WHY DON'T YOU BORROW THE MONEY FROM YOUR FAMILY
WHAT ABOUT GETTING A NEW JOB
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO ASK YOUR BROTHER
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME
YOU HAD BETTER SELL YOUR MOTORCYCLE
HOW MUCH OF YOUR BUDGET DO YOU SPEND ON UTILITIES
THE BASIC PROBLEM IS YOU SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY
MONEY IS DEDUCTED EVERY MONTH FOR MY RETIREMENT PLAN
ALMOST HALF OF HIS SALARY GOES TO TAXES
THE COST OF LIVING IS A LOT HIGHER IN BIG CITIES
HOW MUCH DOES A NIGHT OUT COST IN YOUR CITY
A MONTHLY TICKET COSTS AROUND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
I JUST DON'T EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO GET BY
THE PRICE IS SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS NOT INCLUDING TAX
THERE'S A GOOD BUDGET SUPERMARKET NEAR MY HOUSE
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST FOR A YEARLY RENTAL
I GET A PAYCHECK TWICE A MONTH
MEDICARE PROVIDES MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE
NOT ALL COMPANIES PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES
A DEDUCTIBLE IS MONEY YOU PAY BEFORE INSURANCE PAYS
HE IS EMPLOYED BUT HE STILL NEEDS TO BE THRIFTY
FORTY PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL INCOME GOES ON OUR MORTGAGE
GOOD INSURANCE WAS THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN MY DECISION
HE MANAGED TO PAY OFF HIS MORTGAGE IN ONLY TEN YEARS
MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR MY FAMILY IS AN ONGOING ISSUE
I'M IN THE UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE OF BEING UNEMPLOYED
WE HAVE A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS AND FOOD ON THE TABLE
THE BOTTOM DROPPED OUT BUT THINGS ARE TURNING AROUND
SHE PICKED UP SOME WORK AND THINGS ARE LOOKING UP
A NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE MERGED LATELY
A NUMBER OF THE PROJECTORS ARE BROKEN
EACH OF MY COLLEAGUES HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION
EVERY ONE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS WAS PLEASED
WELCOME EVERYONE THANKS FOR BEING HERE
THE TOPIC TODAY IS CONTROLLING SPENDING
I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY DISCUSSING THE BUDGET
THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS
I'LL FINISH BY GIVING YOU SPENDING PROJECTIONS
PLEASE HOLD ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END
BEST OF ALL THE NEW CONTROLLER WORKED IN AFRICA
AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS BAR GRAPH SALES ARE UP
AS YOU MAY KNOW WE'RE BUILDING A NEW HEADQUARTERS
I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS FLOWCHART
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE SECOND TABLE ON PAGE FIVE
WE SHARE A COMMON VISION PARTICULARLY WITH TRAINING
SALES INCREASED BY FIVE PERCENT LAST MONTH
PROFITS ROSE FROM TEN THOUSAND TO TWENTY THOUSAND
SALES REMAINED STEADY AT TWO HUNDRED UNITS
OUR NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ROSE TO FIVE HUNDRED LAST WEEK
PROFITS HELD STEADY AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
TO SUMMARIZE OUR MARKET SHARE HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY
REGARDING STOCK PRICES THE COMPANY LOOKS HEALTHY
AS FAR AS FUTURE PROFITS WE'RE STILL A MARKET LEADER
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO CLIENTS
AS NEXT STEPS THINK OF CREATIVE WAYS TO SELL THIS
ONE THING THE PRESENTER DID WELL WAS EXPLAIN THE CHART
ONE THING SHE COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY WAS PAUSE
THE CHARTS WERE COMPELLING
THE OPENING STORY DIDN'T REALLY WORK
I HAVE TO ADMIRE HOW SHE EMPHASIZED THE KEY POINTS
SKYDIVING
SNOWBOARDING
SURFING
ROCK CLIMBING
SKATEBOARDING
WINDSURFING
HANG GLIDING
POWERBOAT RACING
WHITE WATER RAFTING
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WHITE WATER RAFTING
SHE'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT IF SHE DOESN'T JUMP
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS THE EXTREME SPORTS TYPE
ON TOP OF THAT HE TRIED HIS BEST TO SHOW ME UP
HE IS THE BEST SKATEBOARDER I KNOW BY A LONG SHOT
ACTUALLY DRIVING IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN SKYDIVING
I COULD FEEL THE ADRENALINE IT WAS SUCH A RUSH
EVERY EXTREME SPORT HAS ITS RISKS
IT'S COMPLETELY DANGEROUS AND ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
HE LIKES PUSHING HIMSELF TO THE LIMIT
ALL YOU HAVE IS YOUR SURFBOARD AND THE WAVES
PARACHUTE
HARNESS
LEG STRAPS
PLANE
FREE FALL
JUMPING
LANDING
WE PUT ON OUR HARNESSES
WE PUT OUR HARNESSES ON
WE PUT THEM ON
PETE TOTALLY WIMPED OUT
I COULDN'T GET MY LEGS THROUGH THE STRAPS
WHEN I STOOD UP MY LEGS WERE SHAKING
BEAUTIFUL DAY TODAY HUH
UH YEAH IT'S REALLY NICE OUT
AND I'M GOING TO GO LIKE OK ARE YOU READY
UH LOOK THIS IS DANGEROUS
YOU READY
I WAS JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO IT HAVE TO DO IT
HE WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS AT FIRST
ONCE I GOT UP THERE I FELT OK
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING
IT WAS JUST LIKE I HAVE TO DO THIS
ARE YOU KIDDING ME OH MY GOSH
IT WAS AMAZING WHAT A RUSH
YOU NEED NERVES OF STEEL TO GO ROCK CLIMBING
I WAS TERRIFIED AND SWEATING PROFUSELY
HE WAS ALL PUMPED UP AND FEELING INVINCIBLE
THE IDEA OF HANG GLIDING COMPLETELY FREAKS ME OUT
YOU HAVE TO BE A THRILL SEEKER FOR POWERBOAT RACING
THE SKYDIVERS WERE FREE FALLING AT BREAKNECK SPEED
IT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE
I WAS SHAKING IN MY SHOES
I COULD FEEL THE THUD OF MY HEARTBEAT
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO PASS OUT
I'M NEVER GOING TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN
DESPITE MY FEAR OF HEIGHTS I TOOK UP SKYDIVING
I'M TAKING SOME TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO HANG GLIDE
HE TAKES HIS DOGS FOR A WALK EVERY AFTERNOON
I FOUND MYSELF STANDING IN THE OPEN DOOR OF THE PLANE
THE POWERBOATS RACED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE LAKE
LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE'S BECOMING A VERY GOOD SKIER
HE WOULD ALWAYS REGRET NOT GOING SKYDIVING
DON'T BE SCARED SNOWBOARDING IS QUITE SAFE
HE FACED HIS FEARS AND JUMPED ON THE BOAT
SHE GOT OVER HER DEBILITATING FEAR OF HEIGHTS
THE BEST WAY TO LIVE IS TO NOT HAVE ANY REGRETS
YOU'RE SUCH A COUCH POTATO
HE'S A COMPLETE WORKAHOLIC
FOOTBALL IS ALL HE EVER TALKS ABOUT WHAT A JOCK
HE SAYS HE ENJOYS BEING A BACHELOR
PEOPLE SAY SHE'S A NERD ACTUALLY SHE'S INTELLECTUAL
I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE OKAY
DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY WENT TO THE PARTY
I'LL HELP IF YOU WANT ME TO
PLEASE TELL ME WHETHER YOU CAN COME
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S AN INTELLECTUAL OR A NERD
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY EVERYTHING'S FINE
YOU CAN RELAX I CAN HANDLE IT
IT'S FINE LIVING ALONE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR HIM
I WAS SICK BUT IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL
I WAS WATCHING
I WAS WATCHING THE TRAINING VIDEO
I WAS WATCHING IT CAREFULLY
DAVE INVITED ME
CAN YOU FILL THE GLASSES
I'M TRYING TO CREATE A SUPPORTIVE ATMOSPHERE
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU WORK OFFSITE
JOB SATISFACTION'S WAY UP
THIS JOB'S TURNED INTO A GOOD THING
I'M FEELING TOTALLY BURNED OUT
SILVER
PASTEL YELLOW
WALLPAPER
CHEST OF DRAWERS
LAVA LAMP
RUG
CUSHIONS
I REALLY LIKE THAT IDEA
I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE SUBTLE
I'D PREFER A MORE SOOTHING COLOR SCHEME
I CAN'T STAND THE MINIMALIST STYLE
THERE'S NO WAY I'LL PAINT WITH PASTELS
ARE YOU KIDDING ME SERIOUSLY
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED AND MORE
MY LIFE IS HECTIC AND DEMANDING
I'M ACTIVE AND HAVE NO MONEY WORRIES
I'M NOT SURE WHERE I WANT TO BE IN LIFE
I'VE REALIZED THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING
SHE LIVES FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK
IT SEEMS YOU HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED A GREAT DEAL
YOU SET YOUR SIGHTS HIGH IF I MAY SAY SO
I HAVE A SOLID BACKGROUND IN ADMINISTRATION
PRIOR TO THAT I WAS WORKING ON MY BACHELOR'S
SUBSEQUENTLY I WAS RECOGNIZED WITH AN AWARD
GRANTED KYLE IS MORE SENSITIVE THAN HE SEEMS
UNDERNEATH IT ALL I'M QUITE RESILIENT
SHE'LL NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF HER DREAMS
I THINK I'M SMART ENOUGH TO PULL IT OFF
I'M NOT JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY
I WISH AL HADN'T BEEN SO COCKY AT THE CLIENT MEETING
IF ONLY I'D BEEN A BIT MORE DETERMINED
MY ONLY REGRET IS I WAITED SO LONG TO TALK TO YOU
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE UNDERSTANDING
HE'S BEEN HAVING A TOUGH TIME SINCE HE LOST THAT DEAL
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THEY OFFERED YOU PROMOTION
I SUPPOSE I'D TAKE IT
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN FIVE YEARS
I THINK I'LL BE RUNNING MY OWN BUSINESS
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU COULD DO ANYTHING
I GUESS I'D TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD
FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE WHERE I'LL BE IN FIVE YEARS
IDEALLY I WOULD RUN MY OWN COMPANY
APPARENTLY HE'D BEEN WORKING IN SALES
REALISTICALLY SHE'LL ALWAYS BE TEACHING
IF THE BUBBLE BURSTS LUKE CAN FALL BACK ON TEACHING
IF THE MARKET FALLS DRASTICALLY THEY'LL LOSE CLIENTS
WHEN THE ECONOMY PICKS UP I'LL START MY OWN COMPANY
AS THE MARKET TURNED AROUND SHE GOT INTO REAL ESTATE
TURN THE COMPUTER ON
TAP ON THE ICON TO OPEN THE FILE
YOU CAN ZOOM IN TO MAKE THE IMAGE LARGER
I TYPED THE DATA IN
SCROLL DOWN THE PAGE TO FIND THE LINK
SWITCH THE COMPUTER ON AND LOG IN WITH YOUR PASSWORD
IS KEEPING YOUR PASSWORD SECRET THAT IMPORTANT
LEARNING HOW TO USE A SMARTPHONE ISN'T THAT DIFFICULT
THE NEW LAPTOP IS NICE BUT NOT THAT NICE
IF YOU THINK IT'S THAT EXPENSIVE DON'T BUY IT
IT'S A GREAT MACHINE BESIDES IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE
THE PHONE IS FAST IN ADDITION IT'S RELIABLE
IT'S REALLY POWERFUL MOREOVER IT'S DURABLE
THE LAPTOP IS PORTABLE FURTHERMORE IT'S POWERFUL
YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE INSTALLED
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BACK UP ALL YOUR WORK
YOU'RE EXPECTED TO TELL IT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE OF YOUR LAPTOP
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO WORK AT HOME ON WEDNESDAYS
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU
I'M AFRAID THAT YOU HAVE A VIRUS
DON'T WORRY THE DOCUMENT IS RIGHT HERE
I THINK YOU'RE IN FOR A SURPRISE
THAT'S REALLY STRANGE ARE YOU SURE
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT A LOST DOCUMENT
HE'S DRIVEN BY CURIOSITY
THE HARD PART IS KNOWING WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE HANDS ON EXPERIENCE
I THINK THE ADVANTAGE IS ITS ADAPTABILITY
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST SUCCESSFUL
SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A BAD IDEA
IF I'M HEARING YOU CORRECTLY YOU LIKE THE IDEA
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HIM
IF I UNDERSTOOD HIM CORRECTLY WE'RE LOSING MONEY
I THOUGHT SHE WAS SAYING THAT CREATIVITY IS THE KEY
I LIKED THE EMPHASIS ON ADAPTABILITY
I'M ABLE TO ACCESS MY EMAIL FROM ANYWHERE
THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD
SHE DEPENDS ON HER SMARTPHONE FOR NEWS
HE'S ALWAYS ENGROSSED IN A VIDEO GAME
THE DAY TO DAY GRIND CAN BE OVERWHELMING
I'M FAMILIAR WITH A VARIETY OF COMPUTER PLATFORMS
HE'S THE GUY WHO WORKS IN THE IT DEPARTMENT
THE COMPUTER THAT'S ON THE DESK IS HARRY'S
THE MAN WHO WAS JUST HERE IS JAKE JACKSON
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT I USE THE MOST IS MY SMARTPHONE
THAT'S THE COMPANY WHOSE CEO WAS FIRED
HE'S CLAUSTROPHOBIC HE HAS A FEAR OF CONFINED SPACES
SHE HAS ARACHNOPHOBIA SHE'S SCARED OF SPIDERS
HE SUFFERS FROM ACROPHOBIA HE'S PETRIFIED OF HEIGHTS
SHE'S SCARED OF OPEN SPACES SHE'S AGORAPHOBIC
FROM TIME TO TIME HE FELT QUITE DIZZY
HER PHOBIA IS A DEADLY SERIOUS PROBLEM
SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SHE FEELS CLAUSTROPHOBIC
HE'S RECOVERING FROM HIS PHOBIA SURPRISINGLY WELL
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR FEAR IS DUE TO
HE ALMOST DROWNED CONSEQUENTLY HE'S SCARED OF WATER
OWING TO HIS AGORAPHOBIA HE DOESN'T OFTEN GO OUTSIDE
SHE WAS ATTACKED BY BEES AND SUBSEQUENTLY HATES THEM
DUE TO HER FEAR OF SNAKES SHE DOESN'T GO HIKING
POSITIVE THINKING CAN HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS
WILLPOWER CAN MOVE YOU BEYOND YOUR PHYSICAL LIMITS
THE POWER OF THE MIND IS INTRIGUING
HOW DOES AN ATHLETE SWIM IN SUBZERO TEMPERATURES
MIND TRAINING CAN HELP BUILD MENTAL STRENGTH
IF SHE HADN'T HAD TO WORK SHE'D BE GOING ON VACATION
IF I WERE BRAVER I'D TELL HER WHAT I THINK OF HER
I'D AGREE TO SEE YOU IF I WEREN'T OUT OF TOWN NEXT WEEK
IF YOU'D WORKED HARDER YOU'D BE VICE PRESIDENT NOW
I'D HAVE GONE WITH THEM IF I DIDN'T HAVE AGORAPHOBIA
VISUALIZATION IS A TRAINING TECHNIQUE
THE PURPOSE OF BRAINSTORMING IS TO GENERATE IDEAS
VISUALIZATION IS USED BY ATHLETES AND ASTRONAUTS
BRAINSTORMING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WORKING ALONE
ACCORDING TO JOAN IBX OFTEN USES BRAINSTORMING
POSITIVE THINKING IS THE KEY
YOU CAN BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE
MENTAL STRENGTH REQUIRES SERIOUS MIND TRAINING
IF I WERE YOU I'D TRY TO BE MORE POSITIVE
USING BIODIESEL FUEL IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
WHAT ASPECT OF YOUR WORK DO YOU ENJOY THE MOST
WHAT KIND OF WORK ENVIRONMENT STIMULATES YOU
HE ENJOYS THE INTERFACE OR INTERACTION WITH OTHERS
HE'S A LUCKY MAN HE FINDS HIS WORK GRATIFYING
IT'S A CONSTANT BUZZ OF ACTIVITY IN MY HECTIC OFFICE
JOBS IN FINANCE CAN BE HIGH ENERGY AND FAST PACED
MY JOB AS A TOUR GUIDE IS LEISURELY AND UNHURRIED
SHE LIKES WORKING IN A LOW KEY ENVIRONMENT
IT'S A REWARDING AND GRATIFYING PLACE TO WORK
HE QUIT BECAUSE HIS JOB WAS A THANKLESS TASK
KNOW YOUR DREAM THEN FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
BOTH BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE CAN CREATE A PR STORY
LIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY AS IF IT WERE YOUR LAST
LIFE IS NOT A REHEARSAL MAXIMIZE IT LIVE IT
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE A MAN OR A WOMAN
IT'S LIVING LIFE THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IT'S PROFESSIONALISM THAT MATTERS MOST
WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WAS MOTIVATE OTHERS
TO BE HAPPY WAS THE ONLY THING THEY WANTED
IF HE MAXIMIZES EVERY DAY IT'S BECAUSE LIFE IS SHORT
SYMPHONY
CIRCUS
MAGIC SHOW
OPERA
PLAY
SILENT MOVIE
BIG SCREEN
REVIEW
GETTING IN THE RIGHT MOOD FOR A PLAY CAN BE DIFFICULT
I REALLY ENJOY BEING PART OF THE AUDIENCE
HE GOT NERVOUS WHILE READING THE REVIEW
STANDING ON THE STAGE SHE GOT READY TO SING
LET'S GO TO THE OPERA INSTEAD OF WATCHING A DVD
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS
THE PLACE WAS TOTALLY PACKED
I'M SURE THE EXPERIENCE IS VERY ENGAGING
I SAW A MAGIC SHOW IT WAS INTERESTING
WE WAITED IN LINE FOR AGES TO GET TICKETS
THE SONGS WERE ABSOLUTELY INSPIRING
THE CAR CHASES WERE TOTALLY SUPERB
THE ACTING WAS EXAGGERATED AND OVER THE TOP
THE SYMPHONY WAS FINE I GUESS
THE PLOT WAS ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE
THE PLAY WAS COMPLETELY UNWATCHABLE
THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTION IS SURPRISINGLY HIGH
THE MOVIE GOT TWO THUMBS UP ON FILMSTAR COM
I'LL PAY FOR EVERYTHING ON MY CREDIT CARD
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE THEATER FOR AGES
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE THIS SYMPHONY
BESIDES WE CAN GET DINNER AFTERWARD
THE FILM WHICH TAKES PLACE DURING THE WAR WAS A FLOP
BUSTER KEATON WHO IS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE ACTORS IS IN IT
COTTAGE GROVE WHERE THE MOVIE WAS MADE IS NOW FAMOUS
SHE LIKES DAI LI WHOSE ACTING IS ALWAYS FANTASTIC
HE LIKES BALI WHICH GOT TERRIBLE RATINGS
THE PLOT WAS FULL OF HOLES
YOU'RE KIDDING ME
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT
IT WAS A TOTAL FLOP
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
I GIVE IT TWO THUMBS UP
THE JURY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE US JUSTICE SYSTEM
THE JUDGE CONTROLS THE TRIAL IN A COURTROOM
THE CASE IS ABOUT A WOMAN CHARGED WITH MURDER
IF CONVICTED SHE COULD RECEIVE THE DEATH PENALTY
DURING TESTIMONY HE ADMITTED TO THE CRIME
THE JURY WILL DECIDE IF HE IS GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY
HER BOYFRIEND WAS ROBBING BANKS STEALING MONEY
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT MURDER TRIAL IN THE NEWS
THE JURY WILL DECIDE IF SHE'S GUILTY OR NOT
THE CASE IS INTRIGUING REALLY INTRIGUING
NEVER HAD HE SEEN SUCH A HORRIBLE CRIME
HARDLY HAD IT BEGUN WHEN HE ADMITTED TO THE CRIME
RARELY IS A CRIME COMMITTED IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
NOT SINCE FIVE YEARS AGO HAD HE SEEN SUCH A ROBBERY
NEVER BEFORE HAD SHE BEEN SO ANGRY
WITH REGARD TO YOUR SITUATION I CAN'T HELP YOU
BASED ON THE CONTRACT YOU HAD THIRTY DAYS TO CANCEL
REGARDING THE NOISY NEIGHBORS WE WILL TALK TO THEM
AS FAR AS YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR GOES YOU NEED TO CHANGE
CONCERNING YOUR RENT YOU MUST PAY IT IN FULL
THE JURY LEFT THE COURTROOM TO DELIBERATE
THE JURY REACHED A VERDICT AFTER ONLY TWO HOURS
THE JURY FOUND THE MAN NOT GUILTY OF MURDER
THE MAN WAS TOO HAPPY TO SPEAK
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVED HE WAS GUILTY OF THE CRIME
THE MAN WASN'T SENTENCED TO PRISON
HE WAS BEING SENTENCED FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT
THEY WERE BEING QUESTIONED BY POLICE OFFICERS
HE CLAIMED HE WAS BEING WRONGLY ARRESTED
SHE WAS BEING TAKEN TO THE STATION FOR QUESTIONING
IN CASE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SHOULD ASK QUESTIONS
SHOULD YOU NEED HELP DON'T HESITATE TO CALL ME
PLEASE SIGN HERE OTHERWISE THE CONTRACT IS NOT VALID
IN THE EVENT OF A BURGLARY PLEASE CALL THE POLICE
YOU LOSE YOUR DEPOSIT UNLESS YOU GIVE A MONTH'S NOTICE
IT WAS WRITTEN BY HENRY JAMES
IT'S SET IN ALABAMA IN THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY S
IT'S PART SOCIAL COMMENTARY PART FANTASY
ONE OF THE THEMES IS MAN AGAINST NATURE
THE MAIN CHARACTER IS HOLDEN CAULFIELD
IT'S ABOUT AN ITALIAN WHO MARRIES A RICH AMERICAN
SHE'S READING A SELF HELP BOOK
SOME AUTHORS MIX SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY
IT'S CALLED THE ECONOMY IT'S A BUSINESS JOURNAL
I'M READING SOME GRIPPING HISTORICAL FICTION
I JUST BOUGHT A HOW TO BOOK ON PLUMBING
THIS GRAPHIC NOVEL IS REALLY GRITTY AND REALISTIC
I'LL GRAB SOME BREAKFAST AND READ THE NEWS ONLINE
IT HELPS ME STAY CURRENT ON NEWS AND DEVELOPMENTS
POLITICAL SATIRE REALLY PULLS HER IN
PERSONALLY I LIKE GETTING LOST IN HISTORICAL FICTION
SO YOU'LL CURL UP ON THE COUCH WITH A GRAPHIC NOVEL
THE MORE I READ THE BETTER THE STORY GETS
IT'S A NOVEL ABOUT A QUEST TO ERASE POVERTY
HE HAS A DEEP BELIEF IN THE POWER OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT
I BET YOU'D LOVE ROOM FOR ENLIGHTENMENT IT'S DEEP
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THAT GUIDEBOOK
NOTHING BEATS A WELL WRITTEN AUTOBIOGRAPHY
I WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE BUT I'M STILL TOO ANGRY
HE NEVER THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET FIRED
THEY WERE GOING TO TRAVEL BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY
SHE WAS GOING TO STAY WITH A FRIEND BUT DIDN'T
I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK COULD I STAY AT YOUR HOUSE
I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
I'LL BE ARRIVING ON TUESDAY AND LEAVING SUNDAY
I WAS GOING TO GET A HOTEL ROOM BUT I DIDN'T
COULD YOU RECOMMEND A REASONABLE HOTEL
DO YOU HAVE A SPARE ROOM I COULD USE
TAKE THE NAPKIN AND PUT IT ON YOUR LAP
TYPICALLY THE FORK FOR THE SALAD IS SMALLER
IT'S BAD MANNERS TO START EATING BEFORE YOUR HOST
EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE ETIQUETTE STILL MATTERS
WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU
IT WAS MY PLEASURE
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF YOURSELF
IT WAS NOTHING REALLY
YOU DON'T GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH CREDIT
THANK YOU FOR SAYING SO
IT'S RATHER IMPOLITE TO USE YOUR PHONE AT THE TABLE
IT'S FAIRLY COMMON FOR HER TO BE RUDE
I COULD BARELY HIDE MY EMBARRASSMENT
HIS CULTURE IS RELATIVELY STRICT COMPARED TO MINE
SHE BECAME QUITE CONFUSED AT THE DINNER TABLE
HIS BEHAVIOR SEEMED SOMEWHAT STRANGE
IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO KNOW WHAT'S PROPER
HIS BEHAVIOR AT THE PARTY WAS UNACCEPTABLE
IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO BRING A SMALL GIFT
IT'S PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO ASK FOR MORE FOOD
THAT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T EVER DO IN MY COUNTRY
HE OFFERED HIS CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY
I'M SORRY TO HEAR SHE HAS PASSED AWAY
THE FUNERAL WAS LOVELY BUT VERY SAD
PLATITUDES AND CLICHES ARE NOT WHAT HE WANTS TO HEAR
SHE FOUND SOME PEACE THROUGH THE SYMPATHY OF OTHERS
I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR OF YOUR LOSS
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE MY DEEPEST SYMPATHY
HE WAS A GOOD MAN HE'LL BE GREATLY MISSED
IT MUST BE A COMFORT THAT HE PASSED QUICKLY
SHE PASSED AWAY PEACEFULLY SURROUNDED BY LOVED ONES
BEING A CARING PERSON IS PART OF THE CORPORATE CULTURE
ONE EMPLOYEE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ANOTHER AT ANY LEVEL
EVEN AS DEBTS ROSE THEY AVOIDED LAYOFFS
SHE HAS A SENSE OF ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
PROFITS COME FIRST BUT WE GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS TREATING PEOPLE FAIRLY
IT'S TIME TO CONSIDER REORGANIZING THE COMPANY
THEY'RE AT THE FOREFRONT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
I'M RELOCATING TO MUNICH TO ESTABLISH THE NEW SYSTEM
JOSH WAS REHIRED WITH A VERY COMPETITIVE PACKAGE
WE'RE FORECASTING A LARGE INCREASE IN PROFITS
YOU SHOULD TOUCH BASE WITH JACOB
ANDREA HAS TWO SERVICE TEAMS THAT ANSWER TO HER
CLOUDLIFE'S GOING GLOBAL
THANKS FOR KEEPING ME IN THE LOOP
THE SALES TEAM KEEPS TRACK OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS
MARTIN REALLY SCREWED UP THE DATABASE
AS A CORPORATION ITS COSTS ARE HIGHER
WITH A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP LIABILITY IS A BIG CONCERN
THEY'LL BE OPENING A NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER
THE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN PRAGUE
THE COMPANY HAS SIX OVERSEAS BRANCHES
UPPER MANAGEMENT REPORTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
IT'S DIVIDED INTO FOUR BUSINESS UNITS
TRY TO INCORPORATE YOUR EMPLOYEES' BEST IDEAS
CREATE TASKS THAT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO EXCEL
WE PROMOTE THE PRINCIPLES OF TEAMWORK
OUR MISSION STATEMENT SHOWS OUR COMMITMENT TO QUALITY
ORGANIZE A WEEKEND OF TEAM BUILDING ACTIVITIES
EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO DO JOBS THEY LIKE
IT'S CRITICAL TO PROMOTE EACH INDIVIDUAL'S SKILLS
ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS INCORPORATE THEIR IDEAS
ON THAT NOTE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EACH TASK IS CLEAR
THEY NEED TO BE INVITED TO COMMENT I LIKE THAT METHOD
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE
I SAY WE LOOK AT THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL THREATS
I'D LIKE TO CARRY OUT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS
HOW ABOUT NO MEETINGS ON THURSDAYS JUST A SUGGESTION
WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS THAT WE USE INSTANT MESSAGING
IT'S A TREMENDOUS HONOR TO INTRODUCE OUR SPEAKER
MANDARIN IS A CRUCIAL LANGUAGE FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
THERE HAVE BEEN REPEATED RECESSIONS IN OUR LIFETIME
OUR COUNTRY HAS SURVIVED MANY CATASTROPHES
THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS
IT WAS BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT CHANGE TO MAKE
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB
WE ARE AMONG THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD
IT'S CLEARLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE WILL FACE
IT WAS NEARLY THE LONGEST RECESSION IN HISTORY
LEADERSHIP IS A CRITICAL PART OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT
MISTAKES AND DIFFICULTIES ARE PART OF THE PROCESS
ALL COUNTRIES EXPERIENCE CATASTROPHES
TRY TO MAXIMIZE POSITIVE IMPACTS
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED
SHE'S HIGHLY SKILLED AND VERY DRIVEN
THE SYSTEM'S HIERARCHICAL AND ANACHRONISTIC
SHE HAS A LOT OF CHARISMA AND GREAT PEOPLE SKILLS
WE UNDERESTIMATED HIS ABILITY
DON'T TRUST HIM HE CAN BE DECEPTIVE
EMPATHY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LEADERSHIP
SHE NEEDS EMPATHY TO UNDERSTAND HOW OTHERS FEEL
AN OPEN ENVIRONMENT IS WHERE PEOPLE COMMUNICATE FREELY
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE HIM NEVER EVER UNDERESTIMATE HIM
WE NEED EFFICIENCY A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY OF WORKING
HE'S A THROWBACK A COMPLETE ANACHRONISM
VERTICAL COMPANIES HAVE A TOP DOWN ORGANIZATION
ALL DEPARTMENT HEADS REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE CEO
PLEASE INFORM ALL OF YOUR STAFF OF THE CHANGES
POSITION IS LESS IMPORTANT IN A HORIZONTAL ORGANIZATION
SHE'S IN CHARGE OF PRODUCT INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT
WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER THAT YOU ADMIRE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A HORIZONTAL ORGANIZATION
I RESPECT ANYONE WITH GREAT PEOPLE SKILLS
I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR YOU
HAVING SELF RESPECT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL
HE'S FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HER
A SUCCESSFUL LEADER EARNS TRUST AND PERSUADES OTHERS
A GLOBAL CURRENCY WOULD LEAD TO STABILITY
CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE BUT HUMAN NATURE DOES NOT
A GOOD LEADER SHARES BOTH VISION AND HARDSHIP
MENTAL AGILITY IS A BIG LEADERSHIP CHARACTERISTIC
SOME PEOPLE THINK MONETARY POLICY IS BORING
I WOULDN'T DO IT THAT WAY MYSELF
SHE HERSELF LED THE TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
YOU YOURSELF KNOW THAT IT WON'T WORK
THE COMPANY SET THE PRECEDENT ITSELF
THEY CREATED THE NEW SOFTWARE BY THEMSELVES
IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP HONESTY IS CRUCIAL
REGARDING FAILURE IT IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE FEARED
HOW YOU SPEAK IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT YOU SAY
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS EMPATHY
ELEVATOR LIFT
SIDEWALK PAVEMENT
APARTMENT FLAT
PANTS TROUSERS
EGGPLANT AUBERGINE
FRENCH FRIES CHIPS
COOKIE BISCUIT
TRASH CAN DUSTBIN
MOVIE THEATER CINEMA
IT'S AMERICAN ENGLISH FOR A FORTNIGHT
THE BRITISH ENGLISH EQUIVALENT IS TROUSERS
THEY SAY IN THE TEAM' INSTEAD OF ON THE TEAM
DOES LIFT' HAVE A DIFFERENT MEANING OVER THERE
THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR VOCABULARY INTACT
ENGLISH IS A WORLD LANGUAGE USED ON A DAILY BASIS
IT PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN CONNECTING A GLOBAL COMMUNITY
MARCUS STARTED USING ENGLISH WORDS TO BE HIP
YOU NEED ENGLISH TO NAVIGATE THE BUSINESS WORLD
WHAT IS ENGLISH USED FOR IN YOUR COUNTRY
PEOPLE NEED TO USE IT ON A DAILY BASIS
IT'S USED FOR NAVIGATING THE WEB AND FOR TOURISM
ENGLISH PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN WORLD CULTURE
DO YOU FIND IT USEFUL FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES
SHE USES IT TO EARN A BETTER LIVING
TRUNK BOOT
HOOD BONNET
WINDSHIELD WINDSCREEN
GASOLINE PETROL
TRUCK LORRY
HIGHWAY MOTORWAY
PARKING LOT CAR PARK
SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH THAT
SORRY WHAT WAS THAT
I MISSED THAT COULD YOU SAY IT AGAIN
JUST TO BE SURE I UNDERSTAND SHE DENIED IT
IF I'M FOLLOWING YOU CORRECTLY HE CLAIMS IT'S HIS CAR
IT WAS AN AWKWARD SITUATION AND I FELT EMBARRASSED
I TOTALLY SUPPORT THEIR DECISION TO BE TOGETHER
HOW DO YOU GET ALONG WITH SUCH AN OFFENSIVE GUY
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES SOMETIMES IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS
HE'S IN A FAR OFF COUNTRY BUT SHE CARES ABOUT HIM
I CAN REASSURE YOU THAT I'VE CONSIDERED IT THOROUGHLY
WHY ON EARTH DID HE DO THAT
WHAT SHE DID WAS UNACCEPTABLE
WOW WHAT AN IDIOT
HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
SHE REALLY PUT HER FOOT IN HER MOUTH
HE FEELS REALLY EMBARRASSED
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU
THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THAT ANYMORE
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING YOUR WATCH
I TAKE IT YOU'RE A BIG JAZZ FAN
PRICES ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF
NICE WEATHER WE'RE HAVING ISN'T IT
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION
IT ALL DEPENDS WHAT'S THE QUESTION
WOULD YOU MIND IF I ASKED YOU ABOUT YOUR JOB
NOT AT ALL I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT
DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT YOUR SALARY
ORDINARILY PEOPLE IN MY COUNTRY DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
HE CAN'T ACHIEVE HIS TRUE ASPIRATIONS IN THAT JOB
TWO FRIENDS OF MINE HAVE DECIDED TO TIE THE KNOT
FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS AND BE EVERYTHING YOU CAN BE
DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET
FAMILY'S IMPORTANT BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER
THAT WAS SO RUDE WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT IT'S INAPPROPRIATE
IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE TO CRITICIZE YOUR COLLEAGUES
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT I APOLOGIZE
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT I WAS TRYING TO HELP
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO CRITICIZE ME
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY
IT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE SO NOSY
THEY DENIED WHISPERING DURING THE MEETING
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES
I APOLOGIZE FOR OFFENDING YOU PLEASE FORGIVE ME
OF COURSE I FORGIVE YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGY I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME
I'M SORRY BUT I CAN'T IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH
IT WASN'T NEARLY AS AWKWARD AS SHE'D FEARED
HE WASN'T ANYWHERE AS CONVINCING AS HE NEEDED TO BE
HER APOLOGY WASN'T QUITE AS SINCERE AS I'D HOPED
HE WAS EASILY AS OFFENSIVE AS WE'D EXPECTED HIM TO BE
HE WORKED ON A GUARANTEED ANNUAL INCOME
HE ACHIEVED WHAT HE WANTED THROUGH NONVIOLENCE
HE STUCK TO HIS PRINCIPLES
HE CHAMPIONED MANY IMPORTANT CAUSES
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR SOME POLITICIANS ACCEPT BLAME
I CAN RELATE TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T GET IT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE
YOU'RE SAYING HE'S NOT TRUSTWORTHY
YOU NAILED IT SHE'S AN EXPERT AT SPIN TACTICS
AGREED IT REFLECTS VERY BADLY ON HIM
THERE'S JUST NO EXCUSE FOR THAT
INITIALLY HE HAD A GENUINE DESIRE TO IMPROVE THINGS
WHAT REALLY DISGUSTS ME IS CORRUPTION
THAT'S POLITICS FOR YOU
THE ELECTION LEFT ME FEELING DISILLUSIONED
BRIBERY IS PART OF THE REALITY IT'S DISGUSTING
HIS MISTAKE HAD LASTING REPERCUSSIONS
DON'T MAKE ENEMIES BY BEING A BACKSTABBER
LET'S NOT PRETEND OFFICE POLITICS EXIST
YOU HAVE TO BE A WILLING PARTICIPANT
MY MANAGER IS MY BIGGEST ADVOCATE
YOU SHOULD SEEK THE ADVICE OF A COLLEAGUE
HE HAS LOTS OF PRACTICAL HANDS ON EXPERIENCE
THE COMPANY HAS A LARGE DIVERSE WORKFORCE
THEIR VISION STATEMENT CLEARLY SETS OUT THEIR GOALS
SHE HAS REAL WORLD ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS
THEY NEED TO DIVERSIFY AND BE MORE COMPETITIVE
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IS REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE
IT'S BEST TO START BY DEFINING WHAT SUCCESS MEANS
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THE ROLE OF DIVERSITY
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT FAILURE IS A PART OF SUCCESS
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL
SUCCESS MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
DEFINING WHAT SUCCESS MEANS ISN'T EASY
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
FOR HER SUCCESS MEANS HELPING OTHERS
DON'T TIE YOURSELF TO ANYTHING
TYPE A PERSONALITIES CONSISTENTLY GET RESULTS
WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET BUT SO FAR SO GOOD
SUCCESS AND FAILURE ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED
IT WAS A LIFE ENHANCING EXPERIENCE
THE COMPANIES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
RECRUITMENT IS A KEY FACTOR FOR ANY COMPANY
THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL
WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA ACT ON IT
HE SAW A GAP IN THE MARKET
BE PASSIONATE AND BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
RECRUITMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
LISTEN TO ADVICE BUT DON'T ALWAYS TAKE IT
A TEAM PERFORMS WELL WITH AN EFFECTIVE MANAGER
FIRST ANALYZE SECOND BENCHMARK THIRD REWARD
REWARDS INCLUDE VOUCHERS
EMPLOYEES ARE ASSESSED EVERY SIX MONTHS
A BENCHMARK IS A REALISTIC LEVEL FOR IMPROVEMENT
HOW CAN MANAGERS EFFECTIVELY MOTIVATE STAFF
WHAT PERSONALITY TRAITS LEAD TO SUCCESS
HER ACADEMIC LIFE DOES NOT DEFINE HER
TRY TO ANTICIPATE PROBLEMS BE PROACTIVE
IT'S HARD TO PINPOINT WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES FROM
THE BUSINESS WORLD IS TOUGH YOU HAVE TO BE RESILIENT
SHE'S PERSISTENT EVEN WHEN FACED WITH ADVERSITY
JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THAT
HMM LET ME SEE IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE
CAN I GET BACK TO YOU WITH AN ANSWER ON THAT
THE LOUVRE WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY
IT'S MONA LISA PAINTED DURING THE RENAISSANCE
THE IMPRESSIONIST EXHIBIT WILL BE HOUSED IN THE ORSAY
THE MUSEUM LOCATED IN A PARK IS SIMPLY STUNNING
THE POMPIDOU WAS CONTROVERSIAL WHEN FIRST OPENED
THE ARCHITECTURE IS CURIOUS BUT VERY DARING
IT SURROUNDS A CONTEMPORARY GLASS PYRAMID
THE MAIN WING HOUSES IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS
THE LOUVRE PYRAMID IS SITUATED IN THE CENTER COURTYARD
IT'S A FOUR STORY BUILDING PLUS AN UNDERGROUND FLOOR
THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF ABSTRACT SHAPES
THE VARIOUS FORMS GIVE IT DEPTH
THE PERSPECTIVE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE REALISTIC
THE CIRCLES AND LINES CREATE A PROFOUND IMPACT
IT'S JUST NOT TO MY TASTE
THE VARIOUS SHAPES COMBINE TO CREATE AN INTENSE IMAGE
THE DARK BACKGROUND CONVEYS A SENSE OF DESPAIR
MAYBE THE ARTIST WAS EXPRESSING EMOTIONAL INTENSITY
HOW ABOUT THIS TEMPERA THE SUBJECT IS RED HORSES
BLUE STANDS OUT AGAINST WHITE BEIGE BLENDS IN WITH IT
FENG SHUI IS A SYSTEM OF AESTHETICS
SPACE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT IN INTERIOR DESIGN
BY FOLLOWING FENG SHUI YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR HOME
BY ALLOWING SPACE YOU CAN CREATE A FEELING OF FREEDOM
ONE GOOD TIP IS TO KEEP THE BEDROOM CLEAR OF STUFF
HAVE YOU SEEN THE FORBIDDEN CITY THAT'S FENG SHUI
FENG SHUI IS GOOD FOR HELPING YOU ARRANGE FURNITURE
BY AVOIDING CLUTTER YOU CREATE A GOOD FLOW OF ENERGY
IT SHOULD BE INVITING SO IT FEELS WARM AND WELCOMING
CHAIRS SHOULD FACE ONE ANOTHER SO PEOPLE CAN TALK
IT'S A CHINESE SYSTEM RECOMMENDED FOR INTERIOR DESIGN
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS SPACE
SPIRE
ANTENNA
ROOF
SIDEWALK
SIGN
FLAGPOLE
MAIN ENTRANCE
SKYSCRAPER
WHERE I LIVE NOW IS FAR REMOVED FROM MY OLD STREET
IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
THERE'S NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO PLACES
LIFE IS MORE EXPENSIVE NOW THAT I'M LIVING IN THE CITY
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE CITIES
MY HOMETOWN IS FAR LESS DANGEROUS THAN THE CITY
EVERYONE WOULD FEEL SAFER WITH A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
WHAT WE NEED IS A STRONG COMMUNITY ORGANIZER
ARE THERE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR REVITALIZING THE PARK
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOW FAR REMOVED FROM WHAT IT WAS
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN YOUR COMMUNITY
RURAL PEOPLE ARE MIGRATING TO URBAN AREAS
HE GETS A SENSE OF SATISFACTION FROM HELPING OUT
IT'S A CHARITY THAT TAKES IN ABANDONED ANIMALS
HUMANITARIAN WORK CAN BE VERY REWARDING
YOU COULD SPONSOR A CHILD WHO'S IN NEED
THERE ARE MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
ONE THIRD OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE UNDERFED
OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE ARE ILLITERATE
THERE ARE AROUND ONE HUNDRED MILLION HOMELESS PEOPLE
ABOUT TWO BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE STARVING
PEOPLE DO BRAVE THINGS AND MUNDANE THINGS
BE READY TO FAIL AND SUCCEED SPECTACULARLY
HE WEAVES DOING GOOD INTO THE CORE OF HIS COMPANY
THE ROOM WAS FILLED TO CAPACITY
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA BUT IT BACKFIRED
HE WANTS HIS COMPANY TO BE A TRIUMPH OF HUMANITY
THE PEOPLE THANKED US REPEATEDLY
HE DOES THE SAME TASK OVER AND OVER AGAIN
EVERY MORNING I WOULD HELP MY ELDERLY NEIGHBOR
ON SATURDAYS WE'LL DO VOLUNTEER WORK
THE MESSAGE WAS RE TWEETED A THOUSAND TIMES
HE KEEPS APPLYING FOR JOBS BUT DOESN'T GET THEM
CSR STANDS FOR CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
IS IT OUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE BACK TO SOCIETY
IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A CYNICAL PR TRICK
CSR WAS A DIVISIVE ISSUE AT THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING
IS A PUBLICITY STUNT THE BEST WE CAN DO AS A COMPANY
IT MAKES SOUND BUSINESS SENSE TO PAY EMPLOYEES WELL
SUPPORTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS GOOD FOR THE COMPANY
UNSAFE LABOR CONDITIONS ARE BAD FOR A COMPANY'S IMAGE
CRITICS SAY IT'S JUST A MARKETING DEVICE A PR TRICK
A COMPANY'S ONLY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS
IN BUSINESS IT'S WHAT YOU CALL A WIN WIN SITUATION
PANDA
GORILLA
RHINOCEROS
BUTTERFLY
BEETLE
COCKROACH
DOLPHIN
SEAL
BEE
WHAT WOULD THE WORLD BE LIKE WITHOUT ANIMALS
RHINOS ARE ENDANGERED RIGHT
WILL THEY FOCUS ON PANDAS OR GORILLAS
IS THAT THE BUTTERFLY THAT'S NEARLY EXTINCT
INSECTS ARE IMPORTANT AREN'T THEY
BEES AREN'T ENDANGERED ARE THEY
THINK ABOUT IT IT'S A BALANCING ACT
LIKE THEM OR NOT WE DEPEND ON INSECTS
YOU HAVE A POINT THEY'RE A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN
LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE
IN FACT ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE NEAR EXTINCTION
IF THERE WERE NO BEES THERE WOULD BE NO HONEY
EVEN SOME ENDANGERED SPECIES LIVE IN THIS DESERT
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAVE A BEAUTIFUL LOCAL HABITAT
THE POPULATION EXPLOSION ONLY MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE
IT'S MAINLY ACTIVISTS WORKING TO CONSERVE THE FOREST
HERE'S MY KEY POINT THE FOREST IS IN DANGER
LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE THE HIGHWAY IS A THREAT
I THINK I MAY HAVE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE
LET'S MOVE THE ROAD EAST BYPASSING THE FOREST
I URGE EVERYONE TO COME TOGETHER
IT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION FOR EVERYBODY
EVEN IF YOU JUST PLANT GRASS GREEN ROOFS SAVE ENERGY
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO FOSSIL FUELS REMAIN SCARCE
TO THE EXTENT WE USE WIND POWER WE'LL SAVE MONEY
I'LL GET SOLAR PANELS PROVIDED THEY'RE AFFORDABLE
YOU SHOULD GET AN ELECTRIC CAR IN CASE OIL RUNS OUT
SHE TALKS AS IF SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT GREEN ROOFS
WHAT DOES SUSTAINABLE' MEAN EXACTLY
THEY'RE USING A TYPE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
IT'S A SORT OF FOSSIL FUEL
UNLIKE PETROLEUM SOLAR ENERGY IS RENEWABLE
GREEN ROOFS DIFFER IN THAT THEY FIGHT POLLUTION
HE USED THINGS LIKE WIND AND WATER POWER
OK I HAVE A QUESTION
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION
I'LL BUY RECYCLED PAPER TOWELS OR WHATEVER
WHY DO YOU GUYS DO IT
I MEAN THE PACKAGING IS HORRIBLE
NATALIE ALWAYS GETS IT WRONG
THEY'RE HOLDING ME PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE
I FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING
THEY'RE KEEPING ME SUPER BUSY AT WORK
I THOUGHT IT ODD HE DIDN'T COME TO THE PARTY
MY FATHER DRIVES ME INSANE
I'M JUST THRILLED FOR YOU
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE
I'VE GOT SOME UPSETTING NEWS
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW YOU FEEL
THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEEDED
I'M SURE YOU'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT
THE CUTS COULD TRIGGER A SLOWDOWN
ESSENTIALLY IT WILL AFFECT EVERYONE'S PAYCHECK
WE COULD QUICKLY RESTORE OPERATIONS AT HOME
HIS BID IS ANYONE'S GUESS
THE FUNDING FORECAST IS UP IN THE AIR
IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD AREA OF INVESTMENT
HIS EXPERIENCE IS PURELY IN INVESTING
THE INTERNET APPEARS TO BE TAKING OVER
HE COULD BE WRONG BUT HE EXPECTS A SLOWDOWN
SHE'S GENERALLY A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE INVESTOR
I WOULD SAY THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF RISK
HE'S BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE NEST EGG
STOCKS GIVE YOU THE BEST LONG TERM RETURN
ECONOMIC INDICATORS GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE MARKET
MY FRIEND ADJUSTS HIS PORTFOLIO ON A MONTHLY BASIS
THE MARKET IS VOLATILE SO TIMING IS EVERYTHING
BEFORE PEOPLE HAD MONEY THEY BARTERED
IMAGINE USING SHELLS INSTEAD OF NOTES AND COINS
SILVER AND GOLD ARE FAIRLY SAFE INVESTMENTS
WHAT CURRENCY DO YOU USE IN YOUR COUNTRY
I DO ALL MY BANKING TRANSACTIONS ONLINE
THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO ALLOW MORE IMPORTS
WE'RE LOSING BUSINESS AND JOBS WILL BE ELIMINATED
HIGH TARIFFS ON OUR EXPORTS ARE A BIG PROBLEM FOR US
THE TRADE BALANCE IS A SOURCE OF FRICTION
WE NEED TO DEVELOP OUR MANUFACTURING BASE
PROTECTIONISM CAN LEAD TO TRADE WARS
THINGS LIKE TARIFFS AND EMBARGOES ARE PART OF TRADE
WE EXPORT A LOT OF RAW MATERIALS LIKE LUMBER
WE IMPORT MANUFACTURED GOODS SUCH AS CARS
ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IS PROTECTIONISM
THESE TYPES OF TRADE ISSUES ARE COMMON
THE ARGUMENT OVER IMPOSING TARIFFS CONTINUES TO RAGE
TARIFFS CAN SAFEGUARD THE LIVELIHOODS OF OUR CITIZENS
PEOPLE IN THAT COUNTRY RELY ON CORN AS A STAPLE
HIS ARGUMENT IS THAT TARIFFS PREVENT FREE TRADE
ALMOST ALL OF OUR ENERGY IS PRODUCED DOMESTICALLY
I SEE YOUR POINT
I CAN SEE YOUR POINT
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING
SIMPLY PUT TRADE HAS CREATED A GLOBAL ECONOMY
HOWEVER TARIFFS COULD CREATE EVEN MORE PROBLEMS
MIND YOU WE EXPORT PRODUCTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES
THEREFORE COUNTRIES IMPOSE TARIFFS ON OUR GOODS
IN FACT A TRADE WAR WOULD BE THE WORST THING POSSIBLE
INDEED I DON'T THINK PROTECTIONISM IS THE WAY TO GO
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY THE EURO IS THE EUROPEAN DOLLAR
HE'S SKEPTICAL IN OTHER WORDS HE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT IT
AN ADDED PLUS WAS USING THE EURO ALL OVER EUROPE
I MISS THE OLD CURRENCIES FOR EXAMPLE THE FRANC
EACH PLACE IS UNIQUE THAT IS IT HAS ITS OWN HERITAGE
HITTING THE GROUND WOULD BE FATAL
SECURING THE ROPES IS SERIOUS BUSINESS
DOING A SAFETY CHECK IS STANDARD PRACTICE
BEING EXCITED IS NORMAL
CHECKING ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT IS CRITICAL
WERE YOU AT THE SCENE
I SAW FLAMES COMING FROM THE WINDOW
EDITORS LIKE SURVIVOR STORIES AND HEROIC FIREFIGHTERS
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT NOT ARSON
THE HOSE GOT STUCK NOT THE FIREFIGHTER
I SAID THE FIRE SPREAD NOT THE FIRE'S RED
THAT'S REALLY GETTING ON MY NERVES
I THINK YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE
YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT THAT
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE
I WOULDN'T RISK IT
YOU'D BE WISE TO STOP
OVERWEIGHT
SENIOR CITIZEN
FIREFIGHTER
HOMEMAKER
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
NATIVE AMERICAN
VISUALLY IMPAIRED
HEARING IMPAIRED
PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED
THEY MAKE THOSE HORRIFIC ADS TO SCARE PEOPLE
SCARE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY QUIT OR DON'T START SMOKING
IN SPITE OF FTC ADS SOME PEOPLE STILL CHOOSE TO SMOKE
MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF TOBACCO
HE ACTS AS IF HE WASN'T AWARE OF THE DANGER
SMOKING IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH
THIS PRODUCT MAY CONTAIN NUTS
NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF ONE YEAR
CAUTION LIQUID MAY BE VERY HOT
INFORMATION ON THIS SITE IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE FACTUAL
THE PUBLIC AWARENESS AD IS TRYING TO RAISE FUNDS
THE CHARITY IS TRYING TO RAISE AWARENESS OF SENIORS
CAPTIVE AUDIENCE' HAS A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION FOR ME
THE GROUP DID THE AD IN HOUSE TO RECRUIT VOLUNTEERS
THE AD TRIES TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO LOVE ANIMALS
SEEMS THAT ALUMINUM RECYCLING HAS SOARED
WHY IS IT FLUCTUATING SO WILDLY
THE VOLUME OF WASTE HAS ROCKETED
PRETTY SOON IT SHOULD LEVEL OUT
IT PEAKED AT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT
FORTUNATELY POLLUTION HAS DECLINED
IN HINDSIGHT WE LET TOO MUCH SIT IN THE LANDFILL
GOING FORWARD THE KEY IS TO REDUCE WASTE
LOOKING BACK YOU CAN SEE WHY IT'S A THROWAWAY SOCIETY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE'D RECYCLED IT
IT PROBABLY WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA
THE PRICE CHANGES ACCORDING TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND
GLOBAL WARMING HAS LED TO A RANGE OF CHANGES
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS TRIGGERED SPECIES EXTINCTION
DUE TO INCREASED TEMPERATURES OCEAN LEVELS ARE RISING
CONSEQUENTLY DISEASES ARE RETURNING
LET'S SAY YOU DID HAVE ALL THE MONEY AND THE POWER
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU COULD MAKE THE LAWS
WHAT IF THERE WERE FIFTEEN BILLION PEOPLE RIGHT NOW
PRETEND FOR A MOMENT YOU'RE THE RULER OF THE WORLD
I'D USE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND STORE RAINWATER
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW ECO VILLAGE
IT WAS BUILT BY LIKE MINDED PEOPLE
THEY BELIEVE WE LIVE IN A CONSUMER ORIENTED SOCIETY
THE VILLAGE WAS ESTABLISHED OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD
THEY REUSE WATER FROM AN ON SITE WASTEWATER PLANT
THEY EAT ONLY LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCE
HOMES ARE BUILT USING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY METHODS
AS SOON AS I HEARD ABOUT IT I VISITED THE VILLAGE
YOU'LL GET HONEY PROVIDED THAT THE BEES ARE HEALTHY
EVEN IF THERE'S A STORM THEY STILL HAVE POWER
UNLESS THERE'S LITTLE WIND YOU SHOULD BUY TURBINES
DESPITE THE COST I'M INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS
WIND CREATES LITTLE CO TWO WHEREAS SOLAR CREATES MORE
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN BIOMASS
SOLAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE AT LEAST THE WAY I LOOK AT IT
TO MY MIND HYDROPOWER IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE COSTS ARE NEGLIGIBLE
IN MY OPINION THEY PRACTICE WHAT THEY PREACH
I FOUND THAT THE MBA OPENED DOORS FOR ME
I'VE YET TO SEE ANY EVIDENCE THAT MBAS HELP
I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUST AGREE TO DISAGREE
THE FLIP SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT IS IT'S AN INVESTMENT
I MAINTAIN THAT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO PROCEED
IT'S MY CONTENTION THAT MBAS ARE A GOOD IDEA
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE GRAPH ON PAGE TWO
THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE HEADQUARTERS
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS QUARTERLY PROFITS
IF YOU DIRECT YOUR EYES TO THE SCREEN I'LL BEGIN
LET ME BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE CHART
RUN YOUR ONE LINER BY ME
HOW SHOULD I LINK THE MILESTONES UP
TAKEOVERS ARE INEVITABLY NERVE RACKING
OUR CORE VALUE IS THE SATISFACTION OF OUR CLIENTS
THERE'S A TWO MONTH PROBATION WHEN YOU'RE FIRST HIRED
LET'S RAISE OUR GLASSES TO BENJAMIN
I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION
WHOEVER SAID QUIET AS A MOUSE' NEVER STEPPED ON ONE
WORK FASCINATES ME I CAN SIT AND LOOK AT IT FOR HOURS
VEGETARIANS EAT VEGETABLES WHAT DO HUMANITARIANS EAT
I'M SORRY BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S FUNNY
THAT'S REALLY NOT APPROPRIATE
EXCUSE ME BUT I THINK THAT JOKE IS OFFENSIVE
ONLY DULL PEOPLE ARE BRILLIANT AT BREAKFAST
ONE GETS A BAD HABIT OF BEING UNHAPPY
NOTHING SO NEEDS REFORMING AS OTHER PEOPLE'S HABITS
UNWELCOME TRUTHS ARE NOT POPULAR
WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR NEWS
I CHECK MY NEWS APP EVERY FEW HOURS
THESE PODCASTS HELP ME STAY ON TOP OF THE MARKET
INSTANT INFORMATION GOES HAND IN HAND WITH SMARTPHONES
THESE BREAKING NEWS ALERTS KEEP ME CURRENT
THE PRINTED WORD IS VANISHING BEFORE OUR EYES
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS HEADLINE MEANS
THE TABLOIDS ARE SO SENSATIONAL
THEY OVERUSE ALLITERATION AND UPPERCASE LETTERS
WHAT A COINCIDENCE
SHOCKING
TAKE IT FROM THE TOP
THE WHO SAYS THOUSANDS ARE AT RISK FROM THE PANDEMIC
EU MINISTERS SAY THE VIRUS IS THREATENING TO SPREAD
YOUR TONE OF VOICE SEEMS QUITE DRAMATIC
THE TOP STORY IS THE VIRUS IN THE REPUBLIC OF RIVENIA
MINISTERS SAY THEY'LL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE VIRUS
THE EU MAY BAN ALL IMPORTED GOODS
EXTREME FATIGUE AND HIGH FEVER ARE TWO SYMPTOMS
YOU'RE ADVISED TO CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY
IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN ADVISED TO LEARN ENGLISH
ALL WILDLIFE WAS AFFECTED ESPECIALLY FOREST ANIMALS
HE SEWED UP ALL THE HOLES EXCEPT FOR ONE IN THE ELBOW
WHETHER OR NOT THEY LIKE IT THEIR TIME IS RUNNING SHORT
IT WAS PAUL WHO STOLE THE DIAMOND RINGS
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS THANK YOU
ALL HE WANTED WAS SOMETHING TO EAT
THERE WAS A MAN WHO HAD A GUN
IF HE STOLE THE BLANKET IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS COLD
THESE COLD POTATOES AND DRY MEAT ARE JUST DELICIOUS
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PLAY THE MUSIC ANY LOUDER
GEE IT'S ONLY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS WHAT A BARGAIN
COULD THIS TRAFFIC POSSIBLY MOVE ANY SLOWER
YOUR DOG'S SO FRIENDLY DOES HE ALWAYS BARK LIKE THAT
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU NEED SOME HELP
DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU ALREADY BOUGHT THE TICKETS
AM I UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY THAT YOU CAN COME
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SAYING
COME ON WHAT IS IT WHAT DO YOU NEED
MAKING EYE CONTACT
TAPPING YOUR FINGERS
STROKING YOUR CHIN
CROSSING YOUR ARMS
PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIPS
IT'S A PHISHING SCAM KEEP YOUR DETAILS CONFIDENTIAL
FOLLOWING UNFAMILIAR LINKS ISN'T SMART
USE STRONG PASSWORDS WHEN YOU SHOP ONLINE
SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS WHAT IF THEY TRY TO COMMIT FRAUD
YOU SHOULD BE MORE WARY OF IDENTITY THEFT
I CHECK MY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS MONTHLY NOTHING TO IT
DON'T YOU HAVE A POLICY ON THE QUALITY OF YOUR FLOWERS
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO SPECIALIZE IN TOP QUALITY CARS
COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW TO RETURN IT
CAN YOU TRACK MY ORDER
IS THERE SOME WAY I CAN EXCHANGE THEM
I'M CALLING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A RECENT ORDER
LET ME FIND MY RECEIPT HERE MY ORDER NUMBER IS KL SEVENTY TWO X
I WANT FULL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE MOUSE PAD
ANOTHER COMPLAINT THE MONITOR WAS BROKEN ON DELIVERY
YOU'LL EXCHANGE THE KEYBOARD FREE OF CHARGE RIGHT
COULD YOU TRY TRACKING THE PACKAGE WITH THE COMPUTER
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
AN ADVANTAGE TO THE CITY IS HAVING EVERYTHING CLOSE BY
ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO ALL HAVE CHOICES
ONE BIG DRAWBACK IS THE MINISCULE SIZE OF APARTMENTS
LIFE'S WAY TOO SHORT TO BE UNHAPPY
IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY ONE OF THE BEST CHOICES I'VE MADE
THERE'S A LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WHERE I LIVE
RECLINING BUDDHA TEMPLE
MACCHU PICCHU
BRANDENBURG GATE
ANGKOR WAT
TAJ MAHAL
CITY OF PETRA
GREAT WALL
PYRAMIDS
THE CITY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF TOLERANCE
OUR MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE ATTRACTS BUSINESS
WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR CITY
OUR UNIVERSITIES PREPARE MANY WELL QUALIFIED WORKERS
WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER LOCATING HERE
I WANT TO REPEAT MY ASSERTION THAT IT DOESN'T HELP
I WANT TO REITERATE MY SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA
I REPEAT THAT I AM OPPOSED TO THE PLAN
I MUST STRESS AGAIN THAT IT WILL BOOST THE ECONOMY
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT AGAIN THAT IT BENEFITS EVERYONE
DON'T KEEP ANYTHING USELESS IN YOUR OFFICE
USING CALMING COLOR SCHEMES CAN CREATE A TRANQUIL SPACE
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WHEN IT COMES TO DECORATING
HAVING A CLEAN WORKSPACE WILL GIVE YOU PEACE OF MIND
FIND THE BRIGHTEST SPACE POSSIBLE WHEN CHOOSING AN OFFICE
ONE GOOD WAY TO SAVE ENERGY IS TO TAKE THE BUS
IF WE DON'T CHANGE WE WILL FACE DIRE CONSEQUENCES
WE'LL SURELY MEET A GRIM FATE
THAT PLAY MAY HAVE DISASTROUS RESULTS
NEVER HAVE WE FACED SUCH A DIFFICULT DECISION
TABLETS ARE IN THE RUNNING TO REPLACE COMPUTERS
THE COAL TRADE HAS AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE
GAS GUZZLING SUVS DON'T STAND A CHANCE IN THE FUTURE
THE SALES OF HYBRID CARS WILL MOST LIKELY INCREASE
MANDATORY RECYCLING SCHEMES ARE BOUND TO CATCH ON
WE NEED TO GET ON BOARD WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY
I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT IN THE LURCH AGAIN
YOUR COMPANY IS REALLY BEHIND THE TIMES
THIS NEW PHONE IS REALLY AHEAD OF THE TIMES
YOU NEED TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM AND BUY A HYBRID
I STAY IN THE LOOP BY READING TECH BLOGS
TO REITERATE MY POINT I AM OPPOSED TO THE IDEA
LET ME EMPHASIZE THIS POINT
ALLOW ME TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS POINT
I'D LIKE TO ACCENTUATE THIS POINT
I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT I FULLY SUPPORT THE IDEA
BRIBES WERE TAKEN BY THE CEO OF THE COMPANY
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN BY EDWARD JEPSON
THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST WAS UNCOVERED BY THE REPORTER
JOURNALISTS ARE GUIDED BY A CODE OF ETHICS
THE BURGLARIES WERE COMMITTED BY A LOCAL RESIDENT
GREED WILL SLAP US IN THE FACE
THAT'S GOING TO COME BACK TO HAUNT US
BY NO STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION IS IT OVER
GET REAL
LET'S GET BACK TO BASICS
I'LL GIVE HIM A PIECE OF MY MIND
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP SAFEGUARD THE PLANET
WE SHOULD GET A GRIP ON OUR OBSESSION WITH MONEY
IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO ENERGY GUZZLING TRANSPORTATION
THEY'RE WORKING TO HELP ADDRESS DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS
DO YOU THINK WE CAN AVOID THE END OF THE WORLD
IT'S MY FERVENT BELIEF WE'LL LIVE ON THE MOON SOMEDAY
I'M TOTALLY CONVINCED WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF OIL
WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING I BELIEVE IN PEACE
LOTS OF ONE CHILD FAMILIES NOT A DOUBT IN MY MIND
HE TALKS WITH UTTER CONVICTION ABOUT LIVING TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
SEEMS TO ME AI'S NOT READY FOR THE MARKET
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE CEO SUPPORTS IT
PEOPLE HERE HAVE A TENDENCY TO SHOOT DOWN NEW IDEAS
THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON THAT ISN'T IT
IT'S OUTSTANDING IN MY HUMBLE OPINION
WHAT CAN THE ROBOT DO
DON'T YOU WANT TO SHOW ME HOW IT WORKS
DON'T YOU THINK OTHERS HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY
MAY I SEE YOUR IMPRESSIVE WORK
WOULD YOU EXTEND YOUR GENEROSITY AND INVEST
THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THIS COMPANY
WE NEED TO TAKE HIM DOWN A PEG OR TWO
I GAVE HIM A PIECE OF MY MIND
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO CRITICIZE ME THAT WAY
PLEASE DON'T BAD MOUTH JOHN I LIKE HIM
YOUR PLAN IS TOO GRANDIOSE
LAST MONTH I WAS LIVING IN A TRAILER
PINK CHANDELIERS WILL LOOK TACKY
I WANT A TWO HUNDRED SEAT THEATER
YOU DON'T NEED A MARBLE AND GOLD KITCHEN
I'LL HAVE MODERN ARTWORKS IN EACH BEDROOM
LATERAL THINKING HELPS YOU GENERATE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
STORYBOARDING IS A WAY TO STIMULATE CREATIVITY
QUESTORMING IS A WAY TO COME UP WITH BETTER QUESTIONS
RANDOM ENTRY'S BASED ON INDIRECT TECHNIQUES NOT LOGIC
BY RELATING IMAGES TO YOUR DISCUSSION YOU GET IDEAS
YOU MAKE COMPLETELY NEW CONNECTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS
GRAFFITI
STAINED GLASS WINDOW
MODERN SCULPTURE
STILL LIFE PAINTING
TONGUE PIERCING
TELL ME ABOUT IT TOO MANY COMPROMISES
THAT'S MY TWO CENTS
I'M WITH YOU
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH MODERN ART IS QUITE VALUABLE
OVER MY DEAD BODY
LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE YOUR PAYMENTS MANAGEABLE
THE BEST THING IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE DEBT INTO ONE SUM
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS IDENTIFY THE DEBTS YOU CAN PAY
THE NEXT THING IS TO IDENTIFY ANY ASSETS YOU COULD SELL
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS CONSIDER SELLING SOME VALUABLES
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS WORK OUT DEBT PAYMENTS
PUT IT ON THE BACK BURNER
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS DECOMPRESS
WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU TOSS AND TURN AND GET FRAZZLED
WHAT FRUSTRATES ME ARE THE CONSTANT INTERRUPTIONS
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO READ A BOOK
THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO SIT QUIETLY
THEY CLAIM THERE'S NO NEED TO BE A CONTORTIONIST
DO YOU DO PMR PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION
YOU TENSE UP YOUR MUSCLE GROUPS THEN RELAX THEM
IT'S A LOT OF STRETCHING AND HOLDING CERTAIN POSES
IT'S UNDERSTOOD TO MAKE THE TENSION JUST FLOW AWAY
IT'S SEEMINGLY REJUVENATING AND MAKES YOU MORE LIMBER
RIGHT
I HEAR YOU
UH HUH
REALLY
OK
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING SUCH A TERRIBLE TIME OF IT
YOU'LL BOUNCE BACK
THAT MUST BE HARD TO DEAL WITH
TRY NOT TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT
DON'T BE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF
AT LEAST THINGS CAN'T GET ANY WORSE
IT MAKES ME WANT TO QUIT MY JOB
IT GIVES ME A SENSE OF PEACE AND WELL BEING
IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY TO BE ALIVE
IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS A KID
I FEEL LIKE SINGING AND SKIPPING
I FEEL TOTALLY REVITALIZED
INSIDER TRADING IS UNETHICAL
REVERSE ENGINEERING CAN BE ETHICAL
GATHERING COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE IS IMPORTANT
DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES SELL INFORMATION
THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN ETHICAL AND UNETHICAL
CORPORATE ESPIONAGE IS GETTING MORE COMMON
I'D LIKE TO RUN SOME IDEAS BY YOU
WHO'S YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE
I'VE GOT A PROTOTYPE READY
I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR OPINION
WHAT'S THE PRODUCT TAGLINE
URBAN LEGENDS ARE JUST FABLES
MYTHS CAN BE METAPHORS FOR SOCIETY
SOME URBAN LEGENDS AREN'T VERY REALISTIC
IT'S JUST A FABLE
FAIRY TALES ARE JUST STORIES
WHAT TIME IS IT

I FELL DOWN AND BRUISED MY SHOULDER

SHE DOESN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT SHE HAS INSOMNIA
HE'S ADDICTED TO COFFEE HE DRINKS TEN CUPS A DAY
THEY'RE HAVING SOME FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
HE'S ADDICTED TO CHOCOLATE HE CAN'T STOP EATING IT
SHE HAS A LOT OF PERSONAL PROBLEMS
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT
SHE'S HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
THE TROUBLE IS THAT SHE'S ADDICTED TO SHOPPING
OH NO THAT'S TERRIBLE
YEAH SHE CAN'T STOP BUYING CLOTHES
YOU OUGHT TO START EXERCISING MORE
HE HAD BETTER GIVE UP SMOKING
YOU HAD BETTER NOT BEGIN GAMBLING
I SHOULD QUIT EATING SO MUCH CHOCOLATE

SHE OUGHT TO STOP WHILE SHE CAN
I REALLY SHOULD GIVE UP DRINKING COFFEE
YOU HAD BETTER NOT WORK SO HARD

SORRY I WASN'T FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS
HE'S NOT WORKING WELL WITH THE TEAM
NOT MEETING DEADLINES IS UNACCEPTABLE
I HAVE A COLLEAGUE THE COLLEAGUE IS VERY SLOPPY

I HAVE A NEW BOSS SHE ISN'T VERY FLEXIBLE
I HAVE A NEW BOSS WHO ISN'T VERY FLEXIBLE
WHAT'S GOING ON
WHAT'S THE STORY
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION FOR THIS
ONE SOLUTION COULD BE THAT I COME EARLY
NO I DON'T THINK SO
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD BE FOR ME TO WORK LATE
THAT WOULD WORK
LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES
BUSINESS IS BAD AND EMPLOYEE MORALE IS VERY LOW
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND STAFF IS POOR
THERE IS A PROBLEM OF EMPLOYEE THEFT IN THE COMPANY
THE COMPANY'S COSTS ARE GOING UP AND UP
COMPETITION IS FIERCE IN OUR INDUSTRY
BECAUSE OF MISMANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS IN TROUBLE
THE COMPANY'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IS A LACK OF INNOVATION
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY
INNOVATION IS THE SOLUTION IT CAN SAVE US
INNOVATION IS THE SOLUTION THAT CAN SAVE US
MISMANAGEMENT IS A PROBLEM IT'S HURTING US
MISMANAGEMENT IS A PROBLEM THAT'S HURTING US
WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY IT'S REALLY OLD AND SLOW
WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REALLY OLD AND SLOW
ONE SOLUTION COULD BE THAT WE HIRE A NEW MANAGER
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD BE TO HAVE A TEAM MEETING
I REALLY THINK THAT'S THE ONLY SOLUTION
THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS TO BUY THEM OUT
I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT WE DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM NOW
LYNN'S GREAT ISN'T SHE
YOU WORK IN ELECTRONICS DON'T YOU
WE CAN TAKE AN OFFICE TOUR CAN'T WE
THEY WERE TRAVELING TO EDINBURGH WEREN'T THEY

YOU'VE MET ISADORA HAVEN'T YOU
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO BEN
HE WON'T TALK ABOUT MONEY WITH PEOPLE HE DOESN'T KNOW
I LIKE TALKING ABOUT WEATHER SPORTS AND FAMILY
NO POLITICS PEOPLE CAN'T AGREE ON THE PRESIDENT
HOW ABOUT WORK YOU'RE AN ENGINEER AREN'T YOU
SHE FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT HER RELIGION
I ENJOY TALKING ABOUT FOOD AND TRAVEL
MY BOSS NEVER TALKS ABOUT ROMANCE IT'S TOO PERSONAL

I GUESS THE NETWORKING EVENT WAS A SUCCESS
WILLIAM SEEMED INTERESTED
I THINK I MADE SOME IMPORTANT CONTACTS
PEOPLE SEEMED TO ENJOY THEMSELVES
MAYBE WILLIAM WILL BE INTERESTED
THEY'LL PROBABLY CALL ME TOMORROW
WHAT COMPANY HAS THE BIGGEST MARKET SHARE
OUR REVENUE INCREASED BY TEN PERCENT LAST MONTH
ASIA IS A VERY IMPORTANT REGION FOR US
THE COMPANY NEEDS TO INCREASE ITS SALES
PROFITS ARE UP BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
WE NEED TO DELAY THE WORK
BECAUSE OF STRONG COMPETITION PROFITS ARE DOWN
PROFITS ARE DOWN BECAUSE OF STRONG COMPETITION
DUE TO RISING PRICES EXPENSES ARE UP
EXPENSES ARE UP DUE TO RISING PRICES
SALES ARE DOWN CONSEQUENTLY THERE ARE LAYOFFS
SALES ARE UP AS A RESULT PROFITS ARE ALSO UP
THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING IS TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE
OUR MARKET SHARE HAS BEEN FLAT
OUR MARKET SHARE HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY
OUR PROFITS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY
OUR REVENUES HAVE INCREASED SLIGHTLY
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO INCREASE SALES
WE KEEP ALL OUR INFORMATION IN A HUGE DATABASE
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY
SHE WORKS AS A DEVELOPER IN A SOFTWARE COMPANY
HE DOES A GREAT JOB AS PROJECT MANAGER
WHEN IS THE COMPANY'S NEXT SOFTWARE RELEASE
WE CAN SAVE MONEY WITH A HIRING FREEZE
I DON'T BELIEVE LAYOFFS ARE THE BEST IDEA
HE DOESN'T THINK THAT LAYOFFS ARE THE BEST IDEA
IN MY OPINION WE NEED TO DELAY THE RELEASE
HER FEELING IS THAT WE NEED TO DELAY THE RELEASE
I THINK THAT WE COULD SAVE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
NO I DON'T THINK WE COULD SAVE THAT MUCH
I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THAT
I'M SORRY BUT I DIDN'T CATCH THAT
I'M SORRY WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THAT
DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD STOP THE PROJECT
SO YOU THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE FIRED
SO JUST TO CONFIRM YOU BELIEVE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
I PROPOSE WE WAIT A COUPLE OF MONTHS
I SUGGEST THAT WE HIRE A NEW PROJECT MANAGER
I PROPOSE THAT HE DELAY THE PROJECT
I SUGGEST WE HAVE A HIRING FREEZE
I AGREE WITH YOU
WE'RE PROPOSING THAT WE DELAY THE PROJECT
THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE
WHAT ELSE
I SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A HIRING FREEZE
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS
HIS JOB IS TO MANAGE ALL THE EQUIPMENT IN THE OFFICE
IT'S BECOME OBVIOUS THAT WE NEED TO CUT EXPENSES
HOW DID HE REACT WHEN YOU TOLD HIM
THE STAFF HAS SOME CONCERNS THEY'D LIKE TO DISCUSS
I LOVE THE LOCATION OF OUR BUILDING
IF WE HAVE TO MOVE I'LL MISS THIS PLACE
THE REAL ESTATE AGENT WILL SHOW US SEVERAL BUILDINGS
WE NEED TO REVIEW ALL THE PROS AND CONS OF THE MOVE
ARE THERE MORE ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES
ONE CON IS THE EQUIPMENT I'M WORRIED ABOUT MOVING IT
AN OBVIOUS ADVANTAGE IS THE MONEY WE WILL SAVE
A DISADVANTAGE IS STAFF THEY HAVE MANY CONCERNS
THE BIGGEST CON IS WE LOSE OUR GREAT LOCATION
A BUILDING WITH A BETTER KITCHEN WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE
BOARD GAME
CARD GAME
VIDEO GAME
DICE GAME
TILE GAME
WORD GAME
PUZZLE
PARTY GAME
GALAXY BATTLESTAR NEVER WORKS RIGHT IT ALWAYS CRASHES
I NEVER WIN AT CARD GAMES I ALWAYS LOSE
A GOOD PUZZLE REALLY MAKES YOU THINK
THIS JIGSAW HAS MORE PIECES THAN THE LAST ONE
GO IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER BOARD GAME
CHECKERS IS SIMILAR TO CHESS BUT NOT AS DIFFICULT
IN AMERICA THEY SAY SOCCER NOT FOOTBALL
PLAYING DICE GAMES CAN MAKE YOU GOOD AT MATH
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE RULES
SURE WE TAKE TURNS IT'S YOUR TURN NOW
FIRST YOU ROLL THE DICE YOU GOT TWO SIXES
MOVE YOUR GAME PIECE TWELVE SPACES
YOU LANDED ON MY SPACE
YOU JUST SCORED A POINT NOW YOU'RE WINNING
IF YOU EXPLAIN THE RULES WE CAN PLAY
IF YOU ROLL TWO FOURS YOU CAN MOVE EIGHT SPACES
IF YOU SCORE TWENTY POINTS YOU WIN THE GAME
IF YOU LAND ON MY SPACE I SCORE A POINT
I JUST BOUGHT AMERICAN VACATION
YOU MEAN YOU BOUGHT A NEW GAME
YEAH IT'S A BOARD GAME
DOES THAT MEAN THE GAME HAS DICE
YEAH YOU ROLL THE DICE AND MOVE YOUR GAME PIECE
COOL HOW DO YOU PLAY
YOU START IN SEATTLE AND YOU GO TO NEW YORK
EIGHT MILLION
FORTY MILLION
NINETY MILLION
TWO HUNDRED MILLION
SIX HUNDRED MILLION
ONE BILLION
THREE BILLION
TWENTY BILLION
SEVENTY BILLION
WE CAN PLAY EITHER CHESS OR BACKGAMMON
BOTH CHESS AND BACKGAMMON ARE FUN
I DON'T LIKE GO OR CHECKERS NEITHER GAME IS FUN
I CAN MEET YOU EITHER SATURDAY OR SUNDAY
I'M FREE BOTH DAYS THIS WEEKEND
I'M CRAZY ABOUT VIDEO GAMES
DICE GAMES BORE ME TO DEATH
I'M REALLY INTO HAPPY PARROTS
THIS PUZZLE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY
I'M TOTALLY ADDICTED TO SUDOKU
I CAN'T STAND LOSING ANY GAME
CHARADES
FINGER
ALIEN
EARTH
SPACESHIP
SHOOT AT
SCRAMBLE IS A KIND OF WORD GAME FOR TWO PEOPLE
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF A WORD FOR EXAMPLE BIG
THEN YOU WRITE THE WORD BUT YOU SCRAMBLE THE LETTERS
FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD WRITE I G B
IF THE OTHER PERSON GUESSES THE WORD HE GETS A POINT
PEOPLE CHARGE ELECTRIC CARS AT CHARGING STATIONS
IF WE USE ELECTRICITY FOR CARS POLLUTION DECREASES
I COMMUTE FIFTY KILOMETERS A DAY
I CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT
WE'VE STOPPED USING COAL
NATURAL GAS POWERS ALL CITY BUILDINGS
POLLUTION
TRANSPORTATION
INFORMATION
TRADITION
EDUCATION
TECHNOLOGY
ROBOT
HUMAN BODY
CELL
MEDICAL SCANNER
DNA
I FEEL OPTIMISTIC
THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE AMAZING
I'M VERY PESSIMISTIC
I'M NOT SURE
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
I HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE ABOUT THE FUTURE
IF WE LOWER PRICES WE'LL BEAT THE COMPETITION
TO GET NEW CUSTOMERS WE NEED TO INNOVATE
INNOVATION IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN OUR SUCCESS
I PROPOSE THAT WE CREATE SOMETHING INNOVATIVE
I LOVE THIS AD SEE WHAT A LITTLE CREATIVITY CAN DO
CUSTOMERS ARE CRITICIZING OUR NEW PRODUCTS
WE NEED SOME TIME IN ORDER TO BRAINSTORM NEW IDEAS
LET'S WORK LATE TODAY SO WE CAN LEAVE EARLY TOMORROW
IN ORDER TO HIT OUR DEADLINES WE WORK TWELVE HOURS A DAY
WE NEED DOWNTIME SO THAT WE CAN PLAN FUTURE PROJECTS
WE NEED TO TAKE BREAKS IN ORDER TO BE MORE CREATIVE
THE CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGY WAS EXCELLENT
NEW MARKETS ARE OPENING IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD
AFRICA WILL BE A HUGE MARKET FOR US IN THE FUTURE
MARK DEMONSTRATED SOME NEW EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY
FOR A TELECONFERENCE YOU NEED A LARGE SCREEN TV
SOME PEOPLE SEEM PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE
THE SPEAKERS HAD FASCINATING IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE
ALL OF THE SPEAKERS WERE VERY OPTIMISTIC
FOR THEM THE FUTURE'S INCREDIBLE
HE BELIEVES THAT ALL ELECTRICITY CAN COME FROM THE SUN
THE SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY IMPROVING LIVES
I FILLED OUT FIFTEEN JOB APPLICATIONS AFTER I GRADUATED
HE SERVED TWO YEARS WITH THE PEACE CORPS IN AFRICA
WHERE DOES SHE GET HER ENERGY
I LOVE YOUR NEW CAR I'M REALLY JEALOUS
YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE FUTURE IN FRONT OF YOU
MY DREAM IS TO LIVE AND WORK IN NEW YORK
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I OFTEN THINK ABOUT WHERE I SHOULD LIVE

SHE HOPES TO HAVE A GOOD JOB BY NEXT YEAR
IN FIVE YEARS SHE'D LIKE TO START HER OWN COMPANY
BY THE TIME SHE'S THIRTY FIVE SHE WANTS TO HAVE A FAMILY
HER DREAM IS TO HAVE TWO KIDS A GIRL AND A BOY
IN THE FUTURE SHE WANTS EVERYONE TO KNOW HER NAME
SHE HASN'T DECIDED ON A CAREER YET
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THE WORLD BEFORE I GET A JOB
IF HE BECOMES A LAWYER HE'LL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
SHE WANTS TO MOVE ABROAD AND LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE
I'M LOOKING FOR A CAREER WHERE I CAN HELP PEOPLE
HE'S GOING TO MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GET MARRIED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE
HAVE YOU MADE ANY DECISIONS YET
NO NOT YET THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBILITIES
IF YOU GET A JOB YOU'LL MAKE SOME MONEY
I'M NOT SURE I JUST CAN'T DECIDE
IT DOESN'T HURT TO GET MORE INFORMATION
I'VE BEEN WORKING THE SAME JOB FOR FIVE YEARS
MY JOB AS A TEACHER IS VERY REWARDING
STUDYING AT NIGHT IS HARD
WORKING FOR THE PEACE CORPS WAS EXCITING
BECOMING A LAWYER IS QUITE DIFFICULT
I'M TAKING NIGHT CLASSES
HIS DREAM IS TO BECOME A TEACHER
YOU HAVE A REAL PLAN TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE
I'M HOPING TO START SPANISH CLASSES
IF I HAD A GOOD JOB I'D BE A LOT HAPPIER
I HOPE THAT I CAN SEE THE WORLD
I DREAM OF OWNING MY OWN BUSINESS
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CAN HELP ALL EMPLOYEES
PROJECT MANAGER IS A CHALLENGING POSITION
SHE HAS A STRONG TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE YOUR STRONGEST SKILLS
HE'S AN EFFICIENT AND ORGANIZED EMPLOYEE
I DON'T THINK HE'S WORKING TO HIS FULL POTENTIAL
I WISH THAT I HAD MORE TIME
HE WISHES HE HAD STUDIED HARDER
THEY WISH THAT THE OFFICE WERE BIGGER
I WISH I WEREN'T SO BUSY
SHE WISHES SHE HADN'T TAKEN THE JOB
YOU HAVE STRONG COMMUNICATION SKILLS
YOU'RE EXTREMELY ORGANIZED
IT WON'T BE EASY BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY DO IT
ABSOLUTELY YOU HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL
IT'S MY PLEASURE I'LL HELP YOU ALL I CAN
GOOD LUCK GO FOR IT
ONLY PEOPLE WITH SALES EXPERIENCE SHOULD APPLY
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN FASHION
I HAVE A DEGREE IN FASHION DESIGN FROM UCLA
WE HIRED HIM BECAUSE HE'S HARDWORKING AND MOTIVATED
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE CLEAR CAREER GOALS
THE BOSS HAS VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF THE STAFF
I'M CALLING TO SCHEDULE AN INTERVIEW
WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN
HOW ABOUT MONDAY AFTERNOON
IS MONDAY AFTERNOON AT THREE GOOD FOR YOU
YES THAT WORKS FOR ME
I'VE GOT YOU SCHEDULED FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AT THREE
COULD YOU TELL ME A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOUR EDUCATION
I GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THIS POSITION
I THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS FOR THE POSITION
ONE OF MY SHORT TERM GOALS IS TO BE A MANAGER
ONE OF MY LONG TERM GOALS IS TO HAVE MY OWN COMPANY
WOULD YOU BE AVAILABLE FOR A FOLLOW UP INTERVIEW
I'D ALREADY DECIDED BEFORE THEY ASKED ME
HAD HE ALREADY SENT HIS RESUME BEFORE THEY CALLED
BY THE TIME SHE ARRIVED THE INTERVIEWS HAD ENDED
THEY'D FILLED THE POSITION BY THE TIME I APPLIED
WE'D JUST STARTED THE INTERVIEW WHEN MY PHONE RANG
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH MORE EXPERIENCE
I UNDERSTAND BUT I'M A QUICK LEARNER
LET'S STAY IN TOUCH
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL MAKE A DECISION
WE SHOULD MAKE A DECISION BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK
DOCUMENTARY
NEWS
REALITY SHOW
WEATHER
SITCOM
SCIENCE FICTION
DRAMA
GAME SHOW
SPORTS
CABLE TV HAS SO MANY CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM
MY FRIENDS CALL ME A COUCH POTATO
I WATCH A LOT OF TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS PROGRAMS
HE'S ALWAYS CHANGING THE CHANNELS
SOME GAME SHOWS ARE REALLY SILLY
I SAW A PRETTY FUNNY SITCOM LAST NIGHT
ONCE IN A WHILE THIS SHOW IS PRETTY FUNNY
EVERY NOW AND THEN WE WATCH A DOCUMENTARY
OCCASIONALLY I LEARN SOMETHING WHEN I WATCH TV
HE'S ALMOST ALWAYS STUCK TO THE SOFA
NATE GENERALLY WATCHES THE NEWS
I SELDOM WATCH AMERICAN STAR
WHAT'S IT ABOUT
A POLICE DETECTIVE WHO FALLS IN LOVE
IS IT A CRIME SHOW
IT'S A SITCOM IT'S REALLY FUNNY
WHERE DOES IT TAKE PLACE
IN BANGKOK
COULD YOU GIVE ME SOME FEEDBACK BE CRITICAL
I LIKE THE HUMOR FUNNY ADS ARE OFTEN SUCCESSFUL
I CAN'T STOP SINGING THE JINGLE FROM THAT CAR AD
THE SLOGAN IS EASY TO REMEMBER REPAIRS FAST
MAYBE SOME FAMOUS STAR COULD ENDORSE OUR PRODUCTS
NICE LOGO A SIMPLE DESIGN BUT ORIGINAL
I'D RATHER USE THE OLD LOGO THAN THE NEW ONE
I LIKE THE THIRD COMMERCIAL BETTER THAN THE FIRST
WE PREFER THE JINGLE TO THE CLASSICAL MUSIC
FOR ME HUMOR IS THE BEST WAY TO ADVERTISE
I'M NOT KEEN ON THE NEW SLOGAN IT'S A BIT SILLY
SARAH WENT TO A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL
ALEX WENT TO A PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
THERE WEREN'T ANY GOOD PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS
ALEX WENT TO A PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL
SARAH'S GOING TO A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY
I WENT TO NORTH HAMPTON HIGH
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I GOT A BACHELOR'S
I DID WELL IN LITERATURE
I GOT MY MA IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
I RECEIVED A MASTER'S IN COMMUNICATIONS
I'D LIKE TO DO A DOCTORATE
MY PRIMARY GOAL IS TO GET A PROMOTION
I'M INTERESTED IN TAKING SOME NIGHT COURSES
I'M PLANNING ON GETTING A CERTIFICATE ONLINE
WHAT ARE YOUR CAREER GOALS
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT DOING
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PLAN
THE ADVANTAGE IS YOU CAN STUDY WHEREVER YOU WANT
AN OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE IS THE COST
ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT THE SCHEDULE IS FLEXIBLE
THE DRAWBACK IS WE DON'T KNOW THEIR REPUTATION
A GOOD THING IS WE CAN START WHENEVER WE CHOOSE
THERE'S NO LIVE INSTRUCTOR THAT'S ONE BAD THING
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO COLLEGE
TRENDS SHOW THAT STUDENTS ARE TAKING MORE TESTS
IF STUDENTS DON'T PASS THE TEST THEY FAIL THE GRADE
THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE IS ABOUT LANGUAGE TESTS
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR WEALTHY CHILDREN TO GO TO COLLEGE
IT'S PRETTY NORMAL TO STUDY ALL NIGHT BEFORE A TEST
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT COLLEGE COSTS ARE RISING
IT'S COMMON TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL WHEN YOU'RE OLDER
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR CLASSES TO START AT NINE A M
IT'S THE USUAL STORY WORK ALL DAY STUDY ALL NIGHT
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S PREGNANT AGAIN
WHOA THAT'S CRAZY
HE'S MARRYING A GIRL THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIM
WAIT WHAT
I HEARD THAT KEN GOT FIRED FOR STEALING
NO WAY
HEY DID YOU HEAR ABOUT NEVER MIND

THIS INFORMATION IS CONFIDENTIAL YOU CAN'T SAY A WORD
I PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANYONE I SWEAR
I HEARD THAT AMY LEFT BEN AT THE ALTAR
OH NO THAT'S AWFUL
SHHH MAKE SURE NO ONE CAN HEAR US
I REALLY SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
WHAT DO YOU HAVE SOME NEWS
I SWEAR NOT TO SAY A WORD
PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANYONE
THIS IS HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
HE'LL GET MAD IF HE KNOWS
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY
I HOPE SO TOO
DID SHE TELL ANYONE WHERE SHE WAS GOING
NO I DON'T THINK SO
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
I DON'T THINK SO EITHER
DO YOU THINK JANE AND SAM HAVE BROKEN UP
I HOPE NOT
CLASSICAL
HIP HOP
TECHNO
ROCK
JAZZ
PUNK
COUNTRY
FOLK
POP
SHE USED TO LISTEN TO TECHNO MUSIC
I'M USED TO LOUD MUSIC I LOVE ROCK
HE DIDN'T USE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC ONLINE
DID YOU USE TO WATCH CARTOONS
ILLEGAL DOWNLOADING IS BAD FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
A SUBSCRIPTION LETS YOU LISTEN TO MILLIONS OF SONGS
DIGITAL MUSIC USES COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SOUND
I DON'T DOWNLOAD MUSIC I STREAM IT OVER THE INTERNET
THE TREND OF ILLEGALLY DOWNLOADING MUSIC IS INCREASING
PEOPLE TEND TO BUY DIGITAL MUSIC NOT RECORDS
THESE DAYS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE SHARING MUSIC
THE WAY IT'S GOING EVERYONE WILL SOON STREAM MUSIC
PROFITS ARE PLUMMETING IN PARTS OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A DISC JOCKEY DJS ARE COOL
IT'S A CLASSICAL ORCHESTRA EIGHTY FIVE MUSICIANS PLAY IN IT
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF COUNTRY MUSIC I'M INTO ROCK
CITY MUSIC HALL IS A GREAT VENUE FOR A CONCERT
THE ELECTRICITY WENT OUT SO THE BAND PLAYED ACOUSTIC
IT'S AN INSTRUMENTAL NO VOICES JUST GUITAR AND DRUMS
COME ON YOU'LL LOVE IT
OK YOU'VE CONVINCED ME LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
LOOK I'LL PAY AND I'LL DRIVE
NO BUT THANKS FOR INVITING ME
THE TUNE IS PRETTY CATCHY
I REALLY LOVE THAT SONG IT HAS A GREAT MELODY
THAT SINGER'S VOICE IS KIND OF ANNOYING
IT'S PRETTY BORING THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A BEAT
THAT SONG ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL SAD
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO YOGA
HE COULDN'T GET INTO SHAPE
YOU MAY LOSE SOME WEIGHT
WE COULD GET SOME EXERCISE
I MAY NOT HAVE THE TIME
ARE YOU AVAILABLE TOMORROW MORNING
I CAN'T MAKE IT TOMORROW HOW ABOUT THURSDAY
HE EXERCISES REGULARLY WITH HIS PERSONAL TRAINER
WE NEED TO DECIDE ON A TRAINING SCHEDULE
WOULD MONDAYS WORK FOR YOU OR ARE TUESDAYS BETTER
THE BEST TIME FOR ME IS TUESDAY AFTERNOON
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE
IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE OF LIFESTYLE
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE GOT TO DO FOR MYSELF
I'M MAKING SOME CHANGES FOR THE BETTER
I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH THE TIME IS NOW
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP EATING SO MUCH BAD FOOD
WHY DON'T YOU TRY EXERCISING ONCE IN A WHILE
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT MAKING SOME CHANGES
YOU SHOULD START AN EXERCISE ROUTINE
YOU MUST FIND A WAY TO REDUCE YOUR STRESS
YOU'D BETTER MAKE SOME CHANGES SOON
IS YOUR WORK LUCRATIVE I MEAN IS IT WELL PAID
MY JOB IS SO ENGAGING EVERYTHING I DO IS ENJOYABLE
IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE CLIENT IS QUITE DEMANDING
NURSING IS AN HONORABLE NOBLE KIND OF JOB
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL WORK
GREEN JOBS HELP SOLVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS
MY DREAM JOB IS TO BE A WELL PAID ACTOR
WHEN I WAS YOUNG I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR
IT WAS A DREAM OF HERS TO BE A SINGER
IT ISN'T AS ENJOYABLE AS BEING A TRAVEL WRITER
WRITING IS AN ART
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT TEACHING THAT'S SPECIAL
SHE WANTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
I'M NOT WELL PAID IT'S DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT MYSELF
DON'T THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE RECYCLE IT
HE'S WORKING TO EARN MONEY AND GO BACK TO SCHOOL
HIS DREAM IS TO BUILD HIS OWN HOME
WE SPENT TWO MONTHS PLANTING TREES
SHE NEEDS TO CHANGE HER LIFE
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO
MY INTENTION IS TO OPEN MY OWN BUSINESS
WHAT'S NEXT
I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MANAGEMENT
I'M GOING TO BE A SUPERVISOR
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
I'VE DECIDED TO STUDY LAW
I INTEND TO WORK AS A LAWYER AT A BIG LAW FIRM
RICK'S VERY TALENTED HE'S GOT THE SKILLS TO BE CEO
MIA WORKS NORMAL HOURS FROM NINE TO FIVE
HE'S SLIGHTLY ODD BUT HE'S VERY GOOD AT HIS JOB
IT'S CRITICAL TO FINISH THE PROJECT BEFORE FRIDAY
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL IS A WISE DECISION
I THINK QUITTING YOUR JOB IS A FOOLISH THING TO DO
OF COURSE YOU CAN DO IT GO FOR IT
I'M NOT SO SURE YOU SHOULD DO IT
IF I WERE YOU I'D DO IT
SERIOUSLY AREN'T YOU BEING A LITTLE FOOLISH
THIS COULD BE THE CHANCE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
YOU MEAN THE CEO ISN'T COOPERATING WITH US
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
SO YOU'RE GOING TO THE MEETING
NO ACTUALLY YOU'RE GOING TO THE MEETING
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A NEW SUPPLIER
NO THAT'S INCORRECT
YOU MEAN THAT THE PROJECT IS CANCELED
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
SO YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THEM RIGHT
NO ACTUALLY I WANT YOU TO TELL THEM
I'M NOT SURE I CAN HANDLE THIS
DON'T WORRY EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT

IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE CUT COSTS
IT'S IMPERATIVE WE MEET THE DEADLINE
IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT SHE AGREE
WE SPOKE ABOUT ARRANGING A MEETING

ARE WE READY FOR THE FUTURE
WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOSING CUSTOMERS

THEY ADORE EACH OTHER THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED
CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR IDEAL PARTNER
I NEED SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE
I LIKE PEOPLE WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF THINGS
HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD
HE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS AND KNOWS HOW TO GET IT
MAYBE SUSAN'S THE ONE
I'M GOING TO ASK HER OUT
HE SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO ASK HER OUT
MY FRIEND TOLD HIM YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL
MY FRIEND TOLD HIM HE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL
I REALLY HOPE SHE DOESN'T TURN ME DOWN
HE SAID THAT HE HOPED SHE DOESN'T TURN HIM DOWN
DID SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN
THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS
IT MAY GET COMPLICATED
IT COULD BE A COMPLETE DISASTER
ON THE OTHER HAND IT COULD BE A GOOD THING
THEY MIGHT FALL IN LOVE AND GET MARRIED
YOU NEVER KNOW MAYBE THEY LOVE EACH OTHER
I LOVE GOING TO PARIS
SO DO I
I HATED WORKING AT THAT COMPANY
I DID TOO
I WON'T BE AT JOE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY

IN MANY PLACES IT'S ILLEGAL TO TEXT WHILE DRIVING
VINCE IS BLOGGING ABOUT HIS VACATION IN MEXICO

WE'VE ONLY MET ONCE
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER I KNEW SHE WAS THE ONE
HAVE YOU HEARD HOW MY PARTNER AND I MET
YOU TWO MET IN HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT
THEY REALLY SEEM TO LIKE EACH OTHER
I THINK THEY'RE TOTALLY WRONG FOR EACH OTHER
I THINK THEY REALLY WANT TO LIKE EACH OTHER
I THINK DATING IS SO UNNATURAL
IT'S BETTER WHEN YOU'RE FRIENDS FIRST
IT'S BETTER TO BE HONEST IF YOU ASK ME

SORRY TO INTERRUPT
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY THE SAME THING
I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF
WELL THANK YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL MEAL
NEXT TIME IN BANGKOK
THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR HARD WORK
ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR STAY
LET'S KEEP IN TOUCH
GIVE MY REGARDS TO YOUR FAMILY
WELL IT WAS LOVELY SEEING YOU AGAIN TAKE CARE
WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE
MY HARD DRIVE CRASHED AND I LOST THE INFORMATION
WE'RE GOING TO UPGRADE FROM THE CURRENT STANDARD MODEL
CAN WE NEGOTIATE A REASONABLE PRICE WITH THE VENDOR
DO WE HAVE A BUDGET TO UPGRADE OUR SOFTWARE
MY COMPUTER DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY
I ANTICIPATE THAT WE'LL SOON MAKE HEADWAY
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE
WHAT'S SO GREAT IS THAT IT'S REASONABLY PRICED
DO WE HAVE ANY FLEXIBILITY IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS
AND REGARDING QUANTITIES HOW MANY
WE REALLY DON'T FORESEE ANY PROBLEMS
WE EXPECT THEM TO BE FLEXIBLE IN THEIR PRICING
THAT MODEL IS BOTH POWERFUL AND DEPENDABLE
IT HAS A SOLID REPUTATION FOR BEING STATE OF THE ART
MY LAPTOP IS BOTH LIGHTWEIGHT AND DURABLE
IT'S DURABLE AND TOUGH DROP IT AND IT WON'T BREAK
THE ENGINEER'S COMPUTER HAS ENORMOUS MEMORY
I JUST WISH THEY WERE MORE FLEXIBLE ABOUT THE PRICE
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING WE NEED SEVENTY FIVE MACHINES
TO BEGIN WITH WE HAVE TOUGH BUDGET LIMITATIONS
WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT
WE WERE EXPECTING A BETTER OFFER FROM YOU
WE HAVE LIMITATIONS BUT WE'LL TRY TO BE FLEXIBLE
COULD YOU CLARIFY A POINT FOR ME
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC
SO JUST TO CLARIFY WE CAN'T ACCEPT THAT PRICE
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT SEVEN HUNDRED IS TOO LOW
TO BE MORE SPECIFIC WE CAN'T PAY THAT MUCH
THIS GENERAL OFFICE LAPTOP IS BASIC AND DEPENDABLE
I'LL NEED TO CHECK WITH MY COMPANY BEFORE DECIDING
WE HOPE TO FINALIZE NEGOTIATIONS NEXT WEEK
BUY A LARGE QUANTITY AND YOU CAN GET A BULK DISCOUNT
THE FULL PRICE WITHOUT ANY DISCOUNT IS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
IT'S UNUSUAL TO ACCEPT A PRELIMINARY OFFER
YOUR PRELIMINARY OFFER IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED
WE PROPOSE THAT YOU GIVE US A FIFTEEN PERCENT DISCOUNT
I'M AFRAID YOUR OFFER IS OUT OF THE QUESTION
I'M SORRY BUT WE CANNOT ACCEPT YOUR OFFER
MY COUNTEROFFER IS A BULK DISCOUNT OF TEN PERCENT
WOULD YOU CONSIDER LOWERING THE PRICE
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T GO THAT HIGH
MY COUNTEROFFER IS FIVE HUNDRED PER COMPUTER
TO CLARIFY YOU CAN'T GIVE US A DISCOUNT
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF WE OFFERED TEN PERCENT MORE
WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK TO ME LATER
I CAN'T CONFIRM THIS I'LL HAVE TO CHECK WITH MY BOSS
I NEED MORE INFORMATION LET'S MEET LATER IN THE WEEK
HAS YOUR BOSS CONFIRMED THAT THE PRICE IS ACCEPTABLE
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT AND REVIEW WHAT WE'VE AGREED TO
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TWO HUNDRED UNITS AT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER UNIT
THE TOTAL OF ALL PURCHASES COMES TO FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS
EVERYTHING'S GOOD NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS
WHAT ABOUT THE PAYMENT PROCESS AND SERVICE PLAN
WE'LL NEED TO REVIEW THE CONTRACT
FLEXIBILITY ON PRICE BROKE THE DEADLOCK
I LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING A STRONG RELATIONSHIP
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU
I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT
TAKE YOUR FIRST STEP
TAKE FAMILY TRIPS
EXPLORE THE WOODS
PLAY MAKE BELIEVE
HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS
GO ON YOUR FIRST DATE
REMEMBER WHEN YOU'D SPEND ALL DAY EXPLORING
WHEN I WAS YOUNG I LOVED HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS
THOSE WERE THE DAYS
EVERYTHING WAS EASIER BACK THEN
I'D PLAY MAKE BELIEVE AND GO EXPLORING
SOMETIMES I WONDER ABOUT MY CAREER CHOICE
I'M COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH IT
I DOUBT THAT IT'S RIGHT FOR ME
I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE IT'S THE RIGHT THING
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT IT
DEFINITELY I'M POSITIVE
LOUIS IS ALWAYS DEEP IN THOUGHT HE'S VERY REFLECTIVE
KATIE SEEMS VERY SAD IS SHE DEPRESSED
SHE'S SO SOCIABLE AND OUTGOING SHE ENJOYS PEOPLE
YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME ALONE DON'T YOU GET LONELY
JOE'S TAKING FOOD TO GRANDMA HE'S A SWEET KIND BOY
YOU DEFINITELY GAIN LIFE EXPERIENCE AS YOU AGE
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU ENJOY RETIREMENT
IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THE AVERAGE AGE WILL INCREASE
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT YOU WON'T GET LONELY
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT COULD HAPPEN
MY FINANCES ARE BETTER THAN I EXPECTED
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OKAY
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP
I'M FEELING OPTIMISTIC
HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE BUILT OUR INVESTMENTS
EVERYONE MUST FOLLOW THE RULES
I'M SORRY BUT THAT'S NOT ALLOWED
I'M AFRAID THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
I'D REALLY LIKE TO HELP YOU BUT I CAN'T
IT'S DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS
EVERYONE MUST SHOWER BEFORE GOING INTO THE POOL
A BURN
ANTISEPTIC
A SPLINTER
A CUT
A BRUISE
A BANDAGE
AN ICE PACK
SCISSORS
BLOOD
IT'S COMPANY POLICY THAT YOU SEE A DOCTOR
I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF
LET'S NOT TAKE ANY CHANCES
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT SERIOUS
IT'S BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT
ERGONOMIC CHAIR
FIRE EXTINGUISHER
SAFETY EXPERT
CARPET
WORKPLACE
LAWYER
EMERGENCY EXIT
IT'S ILLEGAL TO NOT HAVE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
THE BOSS INSISTS ON EVACUATION DRILLS EVERY MONTH
THE SAFETY EXPERT RECOMMENDED NEW CARPET
ERGONOMIC CHAIRS CAN HELP TO AVOID BACK INJURIES
WE HAVE COMPILED A REPORT ON WORKPLACE SAFETY
SHE CONTACTED A LAWYER AFTER HER INJURY AT WORK
WHAT WERE THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
IT'S BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD RECOMMENDATION
WHAT OTHER ADVICE DID SHE HAVE
HAVE THEY DEMANDED SAFER PROCEDURES
HE SAID THE FLOOR WAS TOO SLIPPERY
THERE'S A PROCEDURE FOR EVERYTHING THESE DAYS
THE RULES ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE TENANTS
FIFTY DOLLARS FOR A PARKING PERMIT THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS
FURTHERMORE YOU WILL NEED TO PURCHASE A KEY
THE HEALTH INSPECTOR PUT WARNINGS ALL AROUND THE POOL
HEALTH AND SAFETY PROCEDURES ARE THERE TO PROTECT US
I HAVE TO LET OFF SOME STEAM
I'M FED UP WITH IT
HE IS ALWAYS CORRECTING ME
I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF IT
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS
A TORNADO
A HURRICANE
AN AVALANCHE
AN EARTHQUAKE
A DROUGHT
A FIRE
A VOLCANO
A TSUNAMI
A BLIZZARD
I WAS TERRIFIED WHEN THE WARNING WAS ANNOUNCED
THE HURRICANE WATCH HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO A WARNING
HURRY TAKE COVER IN THE BASEMENT
I DON'T HAVE ANY ELECTRICITY
DON'T PANIC PLEASE TRY TO REMAIN CALM
THANK GOODNESS THE WARNING HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED

A FIRE TRUCK
A RESCUE WORKER
A FIREFIGHTER
I COULD HEAR THIS SQUEAKING OR CREAKING
AND THEN NOBODY EVEN TALKED ABOUT IT
HOW COME EVERYBODY ISN'T EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS
OH THAT WAS A REALLY REALLY SMALL ONE
AND I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE
HOW BIG WAS THE EARTHQUAKE ON THE RICHTER SCALE
I WASN'T HURT BUT I STILL FEEL PRETTY SHOOK UP
IT WAS A REALLY SEVERE EARTHQUAKE
THAT'S TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT
RESCUE WORKERS ARE HEROES
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN IT HAPPENED
MANY BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED IN THE EARTHQUAKE
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED
PEOPLE LIVING ON THE COAST WERE EVACUATED
SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH A BROKEN LEG
THE FIRE SPREAD QUICKLY BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT
WE'RE COLLECTING DONATIONS FOR VICTIMS OF THE DISASTER
THE FIREFIGHTERS NOW HAVE CONTROL OF THE FIRE
I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR INJURY
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT A TORNADO MUST BE LIKE
PEOPLE WERE KILLED THAT'S AWFUL
IT MAKES ME SAD JUST TO THINK ABOUT IT
THOSE POOR PEOPLE IN THE TSUNAMI
OH NO THAT'S TERRIBLE
MY JOB IS TO COLLECT TICKETS AT THE DOOR
THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY AND PEOPLE NEED BLANKETS
A HUGE AMOUNT OF FOOD HAS BEEN DONATED
WE HAVE TEMPORARY HOUSING FOR THE VICTIMS
CAN YOU VOLUNTEER TO HELP WITH THE RELIEF EFFORT
THE FUNDRAISER RAISED MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS
I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THE VICTIMS
I'D LOVE TO HELP OUT
I'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO GO FOR ONE DAY
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO VOLUNTEER
I THINK I'LL DONATE SOME OF MY CANNED GOODS
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE
WOULD YOU PLEASE PASS THE MASHED POTATOES
THIS MUSIC IS GREAT COULD YOU TURN IT UP
WOULD YOU LIKE ANY HELP
COULD YOU REMIND ME WHERE THE RESTROOM IS
WOULD YOU MIND IF I SMOKE ON THE PATIO
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU
WHAT IS IT IS SOMETHING WRONG
I SPILLED WATER ALL OVER THE COUCH
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
DON'T WORRY I'LL CLEAN IT UP
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE BROKE INTO YOUR HOUSE
SUPPOSE YOU NEEDED TO PROTECT YOURSELF
IMAGINE IF YOU GOT REALLY ILL
WHAT IF YOU GET HURT
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND
TRY NOT TO WORRY
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
I'D LIKE TO MAKE UP MY OWN MIND
MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE
SPITTING IN THE STREET
MAKING OUT IN PUBLIC
PICKING YOUR NOSE
POINTING AT SOMEONE
CUTTING IN LINE
SLURPING IN PUBLIC
STARING AT SOMEONE
IT'S CONSIDERED BAD MANNERS TO SLURP IN PUBLIC
I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO MAKE OUT IN A MUSEUM
THE LINE ENDS BACK THERE IT SEEMS IMPOLITE TO CUT
YOU'RE MAKING A LOT OF NOISE IT SEEMS PRETTY RUDE
IT MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD STOP STARING AT US
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD TURN DOWN THE MUSIC
WOULD YOU MIND GOING TO THE END OF THE LINE
IF YOU DON'T I'LL HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME POINTERS ABOUT THE CULTURE
ARE YOU EXPECTED TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES
I'M WONDERING HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE AT PARTIES
YOU'RE EXPECTED TO LEAVE A TIP FOR THE WAITER
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EAT WITH A KNIFE AND FORK

SO MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON YOUR PERFORMANCE
WHAT'S YOUR SELF ASSESSMENT AT THIS POINT
SO HOW DO YOU THINK THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW
THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE NOTICED TOO
LET'S FOCUS ON SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC
LET ME GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN
TO BE FAIR THE QUALITY OF YOUR WORK IS GOOD
YOUR REVIEW MENTIONS THIS AND I'VE SEEN IT MYSELF
SURE I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL
I CAN TELL YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR WORK
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT LET'S BE REASONABLE
DAN I'M SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR OUTLOOK
I KNOW THIS KIND OF THING CAN BE CHALLENGING
I'D LIKE TO SET YOU THE FOLLOWING GOAL
WHAT KIND OF SOLUTION WOULD YOU PROPOSE
WELL HOW DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THIS
WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STATE OUR CASE
YOU'RE RIGHT LET'S TRY TO PUSH FOR THIS
I THINK I CAN CONVINCE THE BOARD TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS
IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION YOU'VE BEEN ARRIVING LATE
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THERE ARE ASPECTS OF YOUR PERFORMANCE I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS
THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS
I'M GOING TO CUT RIGHT TO THE CHASE
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN
I REGRET THAT THESE MEASURES MUST BE TAKEN
NONETHELESS THESE LAY OFFS ARE UNAVOIDABLE
I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE YOU
WE GREATLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK
WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU INFORMED
WE SPECIALIZE IN REPRESENTING LARGE CORPORATE CLIENTS

THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES WE DEAL WITH HAS RISEN EXPONENTIALLY
OUR WORKFORCE HAS INCREASED BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT COMPARED TO THREE YEARS AGO
WE ARE PREDICTING A TEN PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
INDUSTRY TRENDS INDICATE PORT BASED OPERATIONS WILL RISE BY FIVE PERCENT
THE SCALE OF OUR COMPANY CONTINUES TO SHOOT UP DRAMATICALLY
IN FIVE YEARS' TIME THE WORKFORCE WILL HAVE GROWN BY FIFTY PERCENT
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILLING PROCESS
OUR BILLING IS BASED ON WEIGHT OR DIMENSIONAL SIZE
WHAT IF WE AGREED TO EXTEND OUR CONTRACT BY SIX MONTHS
WE'LL PAY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT UP FRONT THE REST AFTER DELIVERY
WE WILL GUARANTEE DELIVERY WITHIN THREE DAYS
WE NEED A TWENTY FOUR HOUR TURNAROUND TIME
I'D LIKE TO RECAP THE POINTS ALREADY AGREED UPON
AND YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH PAYING TWENTY FIVE PERCENT UP FRONT
SO THAT JUST LEAVES THE TURNAROUND TIME
THEN WE HAVE A DEAL LET'S SHAKE ON IT
PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU
I'LL HAVE MY SECRETARY DRAW UP THE CONTRACT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
COULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY
WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS
I'M PRESCRIBING ANTIBIOTICS AND LOTS OF REST
COME BACK IN ONE WEEK FOR A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT
I HAVE A RUNNY NOSE AND PAIN IN MY CHEEKS
I HAVE A BAD COUGH AND A SORE THROAT
I FEEL PRESSURE BEHIND MY EYES
I HAVE A MIGRAINE AND I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
WHEN I LEAN FORWARD I FEEL PRESSURE IN MY SINUSES
IT'S BEEN BOTHERING ME FOR A WHILE
I'VE HAD THIS FEELING OFF AND ON FOR SOME TIME
I'VE BEEN FEELING UNDER THE WEATHER RECENTLY
I'VE BEEN TIRED AND I'VE HAD A THROBBING HEADACHE
I JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT THE PAIN COMES AND GOES

DRINK A CUP OF CHAMOMILE TEA AT BEDTIME
TAKE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIGRAMS OF DEVIL'S CLAW THREE TIMES A DAY
I'M CERTAIN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
YOU'LL BE AS RIGHT AS RAIN IN NO TIME AT ALL
WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME
I CAN IMAGINE YOUR CONCERN
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT
IS EVERYONE HERE
RIGHT LET'S GET STARTED
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING
DID EVERYONE GET A COPY OF THE AGENDA
LET'S KICK OFF WITH LAST WEEK'S ACTION MINUTES
CAN YOU TELL US HOW THAT'S PROGRESSING
HAVE YOU COMPLETED THAT
WHAT'S THE STATUS ON THAT
HOW'S THAT COMING ALONG
THE DEADLINE'S THIS FRIDAY ALISON
OKAY THANKS FOR THE UPDATE
MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER
EXCELLENT WORK KEEP IT UP
GREAT NEWS KEEP IT UP
WELL DONE THAT'S A GREAT JOB
GOOD WORK
OKAY EVERYONE LET'S GET STARTED
DOES EVERYONE HAVE A COPY OF THE AGENDA GOOD
AS YOU CAN SEE TODAY'S AGENDA INCLUDES TWO ITEMS
ITEM ONE OFFICE RULES
IF NOBODY HAS ANYTHING TO ADD
LET'S CLOSE THIS ITEM AND MOVE ON
THAT'S ITEM ONE CLOSED ONTO ITEM TWO
WHAT'S THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA
TOM COULD YOU TAKE THE FLOOR ON THIS ONE
IF NOBODY HAS ANYTHING TO ADD LET'S CLOSE THIS ITEM AND MOVE ON TO ITEM TWO
CHARLIE OVER TO YOU
RIGHT THEN ANY OTHER BUSINESS
WE OUGHT TO GET A MOVE ON
PERHAPS WE SHOULD USE A SEX SYMBOL LIKE MARTY SHAW
SO PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO TONE IT DOWN A BIT
BUT I THINK WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER A SEX SYMBOL
IN MY OPINION WE OUGHT TO USE KELLY BRENT
IN THAT CASE WE OUGHT TO ASK A MODEL NOT AN ACTOR
IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD WORK
TO BE HONEST I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT IDEA
GOOD SUGGESTION BUT I CAN SEE A FEW PROBLEMS
FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA
I'M AFRAID THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION
THANKS FOR THE INPUT BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT
IF I COULD BUILD ON THAT FOR A MOMENT
THAT'S A VALID POINT I MEAN
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER
YOU MADE A GOOD POINT TO ADD TO IT
IN FACT I'D TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER
THE KEY IS TO ACT ON THESE IDEAS NOW NOT WAIT UNTIL LATER
WE NEED TO STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT
I'D LIKE TO CHECK WHO'S DOING WHAT
I'D BE HAPPY TO DO SOME RESEARCH
WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
I CAN DO THAT
I'D LOVE TO HELP OUT WITH THAT
THANKS FOR MAKING THIS SUCH A PRODUCTIVE MEETING
AS WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK WE ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS
WE'RE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
I SUGGEST WE GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION BEFORE THIS GETS OUT OF HAND
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
IF YOU ASK ME WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY GOING GLOBAL
IF I COULD INTERJECT
KEVIN PLEASE LET CYNTHIA FINISH
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP YOU THERE
IF YOU'D LET ME FINISH
CYNTHIA LET HIM FINISH TED GO ON
I CAN SEE BOTH POINTS OF VIEW HERE
LET'S GET BACK ON TRACK
I'D LIKE TO REITERATE
TO RESTATE WHAT I'VE ALREADY SAID
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THIS
IN A NUTSHELL
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SIT ON THE FENCE
LET'S CALL IT A DAY
I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD BE FAIR TO BLAME THIS SOLELY ON MY TEAM
IT SEEMS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE PROBLEM IS ONE OF STAFFING
I'VE BROKEN DOWN THE ISSUE INTO THREE MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE PROJECTS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM
IN CONCLUSION WE HAVE TO IMPROVE OUR WORK LIFE BALANCE
DOING THIS WILL CONSEQUENTLY INCREASE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM
IN A PERFECT WORLD WE'D ALL GET BIG BONUSES BETTER TRAINING AND MORE FREE TIME
I'M TRYING TO STRESS THE FACT THAT YOUR SOLUTIONS ARE TOTALLY UNREALISTIC
CUTTING OVERTIME WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO DEMOTIVATE THE STAFF
ASKING STAFF TO WORK LESS HOURS WOULD DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THEY DO
I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR DEADLINES
THERE SIMPLY AREN'T ENOUGH HOURS IN THE DAY
IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT
I'VE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF REPORTS WHICH SUGGEST
I'VE HEARD THAT THERE HAS BEEN
THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF
I WONDER IF WE COULD TALK ABOUT
MRS LIU I'D LIKE TO RESTATE THIS POINT
IT'S A PITY WE COULDN'T SEAL THE DEAL
WE'LL DELIVER WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF PAYMENT
WE'LL DELIVER BY THE END OF THE MONTH
WE'LL DELIVER ON THE SIXTEENTH
WE'LL PAY BY BANK TRANSFER
OUR TOP PRIORITY IS THE PRICE
OUR TOP PRIORITY IS THE METHOD OF DELIVERY
OUR TOP PRIORITY IS THE DELIVERY DATE
OUR BOTTOM LINE IS FIFTEEN DOLLARS
OUR BOTTOM LINE IS TWO WEEKS WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER
WE CAN COMPROMISE ON THE METHOD OF TRANSPORT
WE CAN COMPROMISE ON THE DELIVERY DATE
I'M SORRY WE CAN'T ACCEPT FIFTEEN PERCENT
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T AGREE TO THAT
UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T AGREE TO THAT PRICE
I'M SORRY WE CAN'T ACCEPT THAT
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT
IF YOU LOWER THE PRICE WE'LL AGREE TO HOLD OUR CONFERENCE HERE
IF YOU AGREE TO HOLD ALL YOUR CONFERENCES HERE WE'LL COMPROMISE ON THE PRICE
IF YOU AGREE TO GIVE US FREE DRINKS AND SNACKS WE'LL HAVE AN AGREEMENT
IF YOU ACCEPT A ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER PERSON WE'LL OFFER YOU FREE SNACKS BUT NO DRINKS
IF YOU LOWER THE PRICE TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WE'LL ACCEPT NO DRINKS
I'M AFRAID THAT'S OUR FINAL OFFER
HAVE WE GOT A DEAL
IT'S A DEAL
LET'S DRAW UP A CONTRACT
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THIS CHANCE TO TALK
I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR BUSINESS
IT'S GREAT TO FINALLY MEET YOU
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOUR COMPANY
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMON GROUND
OUR NEEDS IN THIS AREA ARE COMPLEMENTARY
THERE IS A GREAT CHANCE TO FORGE AN EVEN CLOSER WORKING RELATIONSHIP
WE HAVE EVERYTHING TO GAIN BY WORKING TOGETHER
WE FEEL WE CAN COME TO A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ARRANGEMENT
I CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE BENEFITS
SO IF I GET YOU RIGHT YOU WANT ME TO COME IN ON SATURDAY THIS WEEK
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU NEED ME TO WORK OVER THE HOLIDAY
JUST TO CLARIFY HOW DO YOU SEE OUR OBJECTIVES
LET ME CHECK I UNDERSTAND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO COME IN NEXT WEEK
IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION CORRECTLY YOU WON'T WORK OVER THE HOLIDAYS
LET ME SUMMARIZE OUR POSITION
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I'M BEING INFLEXIBLE
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WORKING MORE FOR NO EXTRA PAY
I'M AFRAID WE HAVE TO BE VERY FIRM ABOUT THIS POINT
THE BOARD HAS STATED ITS POSITION QUITE CLEARLY
CAN I JUST SUMMARIZE OUR POSITIONS AS I SEE THEM
LET ME EXPLAIN WHY WE HAVE COME TO THIS CONCLUSION
THERE ARE SEVERAL ASPECTS TO THIS SITUATION
I ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MANY OTHER FACTORS
CENTIMETER
GRAM
KILOGRAM
LITER
MILE
MILLIMETRE
POINT
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT AN OFFER OF TEN PERCENT MORE
WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOU TEN THOUSAND ON DELIVERY
IN MY OPINION THAT'S THE BEST DEAL YOU'RE GOING TO GET
IF I WERE YOU I'D TAKE IT
IF YOU ASK ME THAT'S THE HIGHEST OFFER YOU'LL GET
CHENG XIN REFUSES TO GO ANY LOWER THAN THAT
I'M AFRAID THAT'S OUR FINAL OFFER
IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO JUST RECAP
ON THAT NOTE I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY YOUR FINAL OFFER
IF I COULD PERSUADE YOU TO RECONSIDER OUR BEST OFFER
WE SEEM TO'VE HIT A STICKING POINT ON THE PRICE ISSUE
THERE MAY BE OTHER ISSUES WE CAN COMPROMISE ON
I'M AFRAID THAT'S ASKING TOO MUCH IT'S NOT AN OPTION
I'M AFRAID WE WOULDN'T AGREE TO THAT
FIFTEEN PERCENT IS AS HIGH AS WE'D BE WILLING TO GO
YOU KNOW I'LL HAVE TO RUN THAT BY MY SUPERIORS
WE SEEM TO HAVE HIT A STICKING POINT
WE HAVE COME UP AGAINST A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK
HOW CAN WE OVERCOME THIS OBSTACLE
THERE IS A BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN US
WE SEEM TO HAVE HIT AN IMPASSE
THIS DIFFICULTY SEEMS INSURMOUNTABLE
I'M HOPING WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS TODAY
WE REALLY GOT HUNG UP ON THE ISSUE OF PRICE LAST TIME AROUND
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PRICE IS ONLY ONE OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES
I'VE COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION
IT CAME TO ME THAT A MERGER IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD
WE'LL HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT ONE
I THINK WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THIS
THAT WAY WE BOTH BENEFIT FROM OUR POSITIONS IN THE MARKET
IT'S TRULY A WIN WIN SITUATION
WHAT DO WE STAND TO GAIN
THE BENEFITS ARE OBVIOUS
LET'S NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH
YOU STAND TO DOUBLE EVEN TRIPLE YOUR PROFITS OVERNIGHT
THAT'S WHY THIS MERGER WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL
IF I WERE TO AGREE TO THIS WHERE WOULD THAT LEAVE MY STAFF
BINDER
COPY MACHINE
ENVELOPE
MONITOR MOUNT
POST IT NOTES
PRINTER
PROJECTOR
STAPLER
A PA HELPS A SUPERIOR WITH ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES
THE CHAIRMAN IS THE HIGHEST RANKING PERSON
DIRECTORS SIT ON THE BOARD AND MAKE BIG DECISIONS
RECEPTIONISTS FIELD PHONE CALLS AND WELCOME VISITORS
THE OFFICE MANAGER ORGANIZES THE WORK ENVIRONMENT
A SENIOR ACCOUNTANT HANDLES A COMPANY'S MONEY
RIGHT SHALL WE GET STARTED
WOULD YOU MIND IF I ASKED WHY YOU LEFT YOUR PREVIOUS JOB
I'D LIKE YOU TO EXPAND ON THAT
SO YOU FELT THE COMPANY WAS NO LONGER GROUNDBREAKING AND INNOVATIVE
COULD YOU GIVE ME A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
ONE MORE QUESTION WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION YOU'VE NOT BEEN ADHERING TO THE DRESS CODE
WEARING SLEEVELESS SHIRTS IN THE OFFICE IS PROHIBITED
IT'S IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE DRESS CODE
THE DRESS CODE STIPULATES THAT YOU WEAR LEATHER SHOES
THIS ABSOLUTELY CANNOT CONTINUE DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME
IF YOU DON'T ADHERE TO THE DRESS CODE IN THE FUTURE I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THIS FURTHER
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR OIL REFINERY FACILITY
DURING THE UPSTREAM PHASE THERE IS HIGH EXPENDITURE
MARKETING OIL IS PART OF THE DOWNSTREAM PROCESS
NEXT OUR TEAM WILL FOCUS ON PRODUCTION AND DRILLING
FINALLY THE CRUDE OIL IS REFINED INTO USABLE PRODUCTS
OIL PRODUCTION IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PHASES
THE FIRST STEP IS EXPLORATION
THE SECOND STEP IS PRODUCTION
THE THIRD STEP IS REFINERY AND SALES
DURING THE UPSTREAM PHASE THERE IS HIGH EXPENDITURE
FINALLY THE CRUDE OIL IS REFINED INTO PRODUCTS
RIGHT EVERYONE LISTEN UP PLEASE
DIRECT MUFFLERS AND EXHAUST AWAY FROM THE RIG FLOOR
KEEP RAT HOLES COVERED UP
ALERT THE TOOL PUSHER TO WORN OUT EQUIPMENT
WATCH OUT FOR INEXPERIENCED FLOORHANDS
NEW FLOORHANDS DEPEND UPON OLDER CREW MEMBERS
CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE
BITUMEN AND NATURAL GAS WILL SHOW STRONG GROWTH
HIGH COMMODITY PRICES WILL CONTINUE
THE INDUSTRY WILL RELY ON HIGH COST HEAVY OIL RESERVES
DEMAND FOR EXPORTED ALBERTA GAS WILL RISE
NATURAL GAS RESERVES WILL BE DIMINISHED
NGC PRODUCTION MIGHT NOT PROVE FEASIBLE
MELOPREPPAN IS USED TO TREAT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
THERE ARE SOME SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRUG
PATIENTS TAKING MELOPREPPAN SHOULD BE MONITORED BY THEIR DOCTORS
TAKING MELOPREPPAN CAN CAUSE MILD NAUSEA
PATIENTS SHOULDN'T TAKE MELOPREPPAN IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER ANTIDEPRESSANTS
BENZYLPENICILLIN IS GIVEN BY INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION
TAKE ONE AMPICILLIN CAPSULE EVERY SIX HOURS
TAKE A FIVE HUNDRED MILLIGRAM DOSE TWICE DAILY
BY MOUTH ONE GRAM THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE FOOD
BY SLOW INTRAVENOUS INJECTION OR INFUSION
TAKE TWO GRAMS DAILY IN DIVIDED DOSES
MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL THE NECESSARY VACCINATIONS WELL IN ADVANCE
FOR KENYA YOU'LL NEED SHOTS FOR TYPHOID AND HEPATITIS A
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF MALARIA IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA
YOU HAVE TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST MOSQUITO BITES
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE SOMETHING HANDY TO RELIEVE A HEADACHE
YOU'D BETTER TAKE A SUITABLE SUN BLOCK
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE
PLEASE HELP ME GIVE A VERY WARM WELCOME TO SARAH ANDREWS
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW ME MY NAME'S SARAH ANDREWS
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE MARKETING SECTOR FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS
AS YOU CAN SEE SALES HAVE GROWN STEADILY
IF I CAN DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE LINE GRAPH
HAVE A LOOK AT THE PIE CHART
LET'S BEGIN BY LOOKING AT LAST YEAR'S SALES
BEFORE I WRAP UP I'D LIKE TO SUMMARIZE MY MAIN POINTS
SO TO RECAP
IN SUMMARY MY PRESENTATION CONSISTED OF THREE MAIN POINTS
BEFORE I CONCLUDE LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH MY MAIN POINTS ONCE MORE

TABLE
PIE CHART
BUBBLE CHART
TREE CHART
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART
IN THE FIRST QUARTER MIA MOTORS' SALES ROSE STEADILY
IN THE FIRST QUARTER RED SUN'S SALES ROSE SLIGHTLY
GAZELLE'S SALES ROSE SHARPLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER
IN THE THIRD QUARTER GAZELLE'S SALES FELL DRAMATICALLY
OKAY MOVING ON I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THIS PIE CHART
THE CHART SHOWS THE MARKET SHARE OF MIA MOTORS AND THAT OF ITS TWO MAIN COMPETITORS
AS YOU CAN SEE MIA MOTORS NOW HOLDS TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF THE MARKET
RED SUN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE MARKET
HERE ARE THE PROJECTIONS FOR THE NEXT QUARTER
IF I COULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS BAR CHART
WE ARE PREDICTING THAT RED SUN WILL RELEASE THEIR MID RANGE MODEL NEXT QUARTER
IT'S PROJECTED THAT GAZELLE'S SALES WILL CONTINUE TO BOTTOM OUT
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION
THAT'S A VERY PERTINENT QUESTION
I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN EXPLAIN THAT RIGHT NOW
CAN I GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE
I'M NOT SURE I SEE THE RELEVANCE OF THAT QUESTION
I'M AFRAID THAT'S OUTSIDE THE AREA OF MY EXPERTISE
IT SEEMS THAT A NUMBER OF ERRORS OCCURRED
THE CORRECT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS WERE NOT INTERVIEWED
ENOUGH TIME WASN'T TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THE RESULTS WERE ANALYZED
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT TESTING
WELL TO SOME EXTENT THAT COULD BE SAID TO BE THE CASE
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN
AS YOU KNOW
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ALL
I AM SURE YOU WILL AGREE
REST ASSURED
I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
IT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE INDUSTRY
THE RESULTS WERE STAGGERING LOOK AT THESE FIGURES
I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THE SKY IS THE LIMIT
I THINK THIS NEW DESIGN IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR NEEDS

HEAR ME OUT
JUST GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES AND I'LL GET TO THAT
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT HERE
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO NO MORE STAFF CUTBACKS
SO LET ME START WITH THE BAD NEWS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SURVIVAL OF OUR COMPANY HERE
QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH FOCUSES ON OBJECTIVE DATA
DATA IS INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR EVALUATION
ANALYTICAL COMPARISON CONCERNS STATISTICS
A TREND IS A GENERAL DEVELOPMENT IN A SITUATION
THE ABSTRACT SUMMARIZES THE WHOLE RESEARCH PROJECT
STUDY PROTOCOLS ARE SET OUT IN THE METHODOLOGY SECTION

WE MAKE SUGGESTIONS IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION
THE BIBLIOGRAPHY STATES LITERATURE SOURCES WE'VE USED

LOOKING AT HABITAT ALL THREE SPECIES INHABIT VARYING TYPES OF LAND
PLACE SOME MOIST FILTER PAPER IN TWO PETRI DISHES
PLACE TEN SEEDS ON TOP OF THE FILTER PAPER IN EACH PETRI DISH
ADD WATER TO THE PETRI DISHES EVERY TWO OR THREE DAYS
GERMINATION OCCURS WHEN AT LEAST ONE WHITE RADICAL EMERGES FROM A SEED

WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING A TREND TOWARDS CONVENIENCE
PHONES HAVE BEEN EVOLVING INTO MULTIFUNCTIONAL DEVICES
IF I HAD MORE FREE TIME I WOULD READ MORE
AT THE END OF THE DAY OVERWORKING CAN LEAD TO STRESS
BACK SPASMS ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF SITTING DOWN ALL DAY
LACK OF SLEEP CAN BE A RESULT OF WORKING LONG HOURS
MIGRAINES MAY COME FROM THE NOISE POLLUTION OF CITIES
A SPA HAS THE EFFECT OF RELAXING YOUR BODY
RESEARCH SHOWS THE WORKING WEEK IS GETTING SHORTER
PEOPLE ARE RETIRING EARLIER
WE OFTEN TREAT OUR LEISURE ACTIVITIES AS OBLIGATIONS
MODERN LIVING CAN BE COMPETITIVE AND EXHAUSTING
PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME ON LEISURE ACTIVITIES
THIS IS A GREAT PARTY
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE
SO WHERE IS THE DASHING MR PETERSON
SO WHAT DO YOU DO ANDREW
WHAT DO YOU THINK AMANDA
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN INTERESTING PROJECT

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I SHOWED YOU AROUND
I WOULDN'T WANT TO IMPOSE
IT WOULD BE NO IMPOSITION AT ALL
FIRST OF ALL YOU BOTH NEED TO CALM DOWN
LET'S TRY TO AVOID ANY RUDENESS HERE
DUNCAN I NEED YOU TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
FURTHERMORE I NEED YOU TO DROP THAT ATTITUDE
ERIC YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE TO SPEAK IN A MOMENT
ERIC IS THIS AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT DO YOU THINK
GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S ANGELA DEMARCO
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE EXCELLENCE HOTEL GROUP
I THINK YOU'RE EXPECTING ME
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF
HOW DO YOU DO
HOW DO YOU DO
I THINK WE'VE SPOKEN ON THE PHONE
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU
I THOUGHT THE FISH WAS DELICIOUS
I AGREE IT WAS REALLY GOOD
I'M AFRAID I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT GOOD
IN MY OPINION CELL PHONES ARE DESTROYING THE ART OF CONVERSATION
IF YOU ASK ME THE BENEFITS OF CELL PHONES ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE DRAWBACKS
I DON'T AGREE I BELIEVE THEY MAKE LIFE MORE COMPLICATED
I CAN SEE BOTH YOUR POINTS OF VIEW
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
COULD YOU CLARIFY THAT
WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING THAT
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS
LET ME EXPLAIN
IF I COULD CLARIFY THAT
SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING
IF I COULD INTERRUPT YOU THERE
IF I COULD BUTT IN
BLUETOOTH
KEYPAD
RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
SMS
TOUCHSCREEN
INTERACTION IS EASIER WITH A TOUCHSCREEN
IF YOU WANT TO GET ONLINE THEN YOU NEED WI FI
COMPARED TO SMS BLUETOOTH IS A NEWER TECHNOLOGY
THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROVIDERS
THE KEYPAD IS A TRADITIONAL FEATURE OF CELL PHONES
A PHONE WITH A BUILT IN CAMERA IS YOUR BEST BET
THE SERVICE MUST INTEGRATE INTO THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY
WE WILL RESPECT CUSTOMERS' PRIVACY WITH THE SERVICE
WE ARE FOLLOWING ALL THE ANTI MONOPOLY REGULATIONS
WE'LL BEGIN TO APPROACH MOBILE PHONE MANUFACTURERS
WE'RE IN A GOOD POSITION TO GAIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
AT T WAS SET UP TO RUN THE US' FIRST TELEPHONE NETWORK

THE LINE IS CLEAR NOW SO PLEASE GO AHEAD
MY APOLOGIES FOR ENDING OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION SO ABRUPTLY

I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME TODAY
CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA AS TO THE SCOPE OF YOUR LAST POSITION
CAN YOU TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
HAVE YOU EVER DONE A PHONE INTERVIEW BEFORE
I WAS GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO BE CREATIVE
I WAS ENCOURAGED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
WELL AT FIRST I FOUND IT VERY STRESSFUL
IT TOOK SOME TIME TO LEARN HOW TO LEAD A TEAM
IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE FLEXIBLE AND FORWARD THINKING
I TRY TO DEAL WITH EACH SITUATION AS IT ARISES
I AM WILLING TO LEARN AND I AM WILLING TO LISTEN
TURKEY IS BENEFITING FROM THE RISE IN ECOTOURISM
A ROAD TRIP CAN BE CHALLENGING BUT EXCITING
A FAMILY TRIP TO SPAIN CAN BE DONE ON A BUDGET
ARCHITECTURE TOURS CAN BE DONE IN CITIES OR COUNTRIES
CRUISES LEAVE FROM MOST PORTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
TAKE A QUICK GLIMPSE OF U S CITIES ON A BUS TOUR
LET ME JUST CONFIRM YOUR ITINERARY
I'M CALLING TO CONFIRM SOME DETAILS ABOUT YOUR TRIP
IN THAT CASE I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE REGIS
YOU ARE ALL SET TO DEPART AT EIGHT FIFTEEN A.M ON SEVENTEENTH MARCH
I'M AFRAID THE FLIGHT YOU WANTED IS FULLY BOOKED
WOULD YOU CONSIDER TAKING AN EARLIER FLIGHT
YOU'LL FIND THE MOST PRISTINE BEACHES IN THE AREA
FOR A MORE ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT EXPLORE THE INLETS
ADMIRE THE BREATHTAKING PICTURESQUE SCENERY
EXPLORE THE RUGGED ROCKY MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS
ENJOY THE EXOTIC SPICY VIETNAMESE CUISINE
KASBA LAKE OFFERS A TRANQUIL AND SCENIC EXPERIENCE
HAVE THE CHEF PREPARE YOU A HEARTY MEAL
YOU COULD CATCH THE TRAIN
I THINK WE SHOULD STICK TO THE FLIGHT
THERE ARE TAXIS READILY AVAILABLE TO TAKE YOU AROUND
YOU COULD ALSO HOP ON A LOCAL BUS
I SUGGEST GRABBING A CAB
HE WON'T GO FOR THE HELICOPTER TOUR
CAR SERVICES OFFER A SURPRISINGLY REASONABLE RATE
CABS ARE AN AFFORDABLE OPTION IF YOU'RE IN A GROUP
THE SUBWAY IS THE FASTEST WAY TO GET AROUND THE CITY
BUSES OFFER THE ADVANTAGE OF A WINDOW TO LOOK OUT OF
SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND IS BY WALKING
BIKE
BUS
CAB
CAR
COACH
